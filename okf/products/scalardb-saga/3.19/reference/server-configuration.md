# Server configuration reference

The server image ships this file at `/scalardb-saga/conf/server.properties` and passes it to the process with `--config`. It is a *template*: as shipped it does not start, because a ScalarDB store, at least one saga definition and a security provider are required and cannot be guessed. Commented-out lines show each key's default value, so this file is also the authoritative list of settings and defaults.

A misspelled `scalar.db.saga.server.*` key fails startup rather than being ignored. Any value under `scalar.db.saga.*` may use a secret reference — `${env:NAME}` or `${file:UTF-8:/path}`; plain `scalar.db.*` keys are resolved by ScalarDB itself, which supports `${env:...}` but not `${file:...}`.

## `server/docker/conf/server.properties`

```properties
# ScalarDB Saga daemon configuration — TEMPLATE.
#
# The image ships this file at /scalardb-saga/conf/server.properties and passes it to the server
# with --config. As shipped it does NOT start: every REPLACE_ME below is a value the daemon
# requires and cannot guess, and no security provider is selected. Replace it by mounting over
# /scalardb-saga/conf, or point the server at another path by overriding the container command
# (`--config /path/to/server.properties`).
#
# Every key below is documented on SagaServerConfig, except the security.jwt.* and security.apikey.*
# keys, which are documented on JwtConfig and ApiKeyConfig. A misspelled scalar.db.saga.server.* key
# fails startup rather than being ignored: a typo is otherwise indistinguishable from leaving the
# setting unset, which would serve traffic under a policy you believe you changed. Commented-out
# lines below show each key's default value. Any value in the scalar.db.saga.*
# namespace may use a secret reference — ${env:NAME} or ${file:UTF-8:/path} (a mounted Kubernetes
# Secret) — which is resolved at startup. Keys in the plain scalar.db.* namespace are resolved by
# ScalarDB itself, which supports ${env:...} but NOT ${file:...}.

# --- ScalarDB store (required) -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Where the daemon persists saga state. This is the durable record of every in-flight saga, so it
# must be a real, backed-up database — not ephemeral container storage.
scalar.db.storage=jdbc
scalar.db.contact_points=jdbc:postgresql://REPLACE_ME:5432/scalardb
scalar.db.username=${env:SCALAR_DB_USERNAME}
scalar.db.password=${env:SCALAR_DB_PASSWORD}

# --- Saga definitions (required) ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A file or directory of JSON/YAML saga definitions, loaded once at startup. The daemon refuses to
# start with none registered, rather than serving a healthy but useless process. Daemon mode is
# declarative-only: a definition naming a code step (stepClass) is rejected, since an operator cannot
# add classes to this image.
scalar.db.saga.server.definitions_path=/scalardb-saga/conf/definitions

# --- Transports -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Both are enabled by default; disabling one leaves its port unbound. At least one must stay enabled,
# and while both are, they cannot name the same port. `host` is shared by the two listeners.
scalar.db.saga.server.host=0.0.0.0
scalar.db.saga.server.http.port=12080
scalar.db.saga.server.grpc.port=12051
# scalar.db.saga.server.http.enabled=true
# scalar.db.saga.server.grpc.enabled=true
# Jetty's request thread pool, and the queue in front of it. Once max_threads are busy, requests
# beyond max_queued_requests are shed rather than queued unboundedly, which bounds the delay a
# caller can accumulate instead of letting a burst of slow requests pile up.
# scalar.db.saga.server.http.max_threads=200
# scalar.db.saga.server.http.min_threads=8
# scalar.db.saga.server.http.max_queued_requests=400
# Raise only if legitimate credentials do not fit — a JWT with many claims is the usual reason. The
# gRPC *message* cap has no key: it is derived from store.max_event_payload_bytes, so no transport
# can accept an input the store would then reject.
# scalar.db.saga.server.grpc.max_inbound_metadata_bytes=8192

# --- Instance identity ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The identity this instance stamps on the sagas it claims during recovery. Defaults to a random
# UUID per process, which is safe but untraceable: a stuck saga then names a value that matches no
# pod you can find. Two live instances must never share one — the claim is what stops two replicas
# from driving the same saga, so use the pod name, not a fixed string.
# scalar.db.saga.server.owner_id=${env:HOSTNAME}

# --- Security (configure before exposing the daemon) -------------------------------------------
# No provider is selected, so the daemon falls back to `noop`, which authenticates nothing. Because
# host is 0.0.0.0 above, that combination REFUSES TO START — a deliberate guard against an
# unauthenticated coordinator on a reachable interface. Uncomment exactly one of the two real
# provider blocks below, never both.
#
# Fill in every REPLACE_ME while you are there: a placeholder is a syntactically valid value, so the
# daemon accepts it at startup and fails only later, when a caller first presents a credential.
#
# `jwt` makes the daemon an OAuth 2.0 resource server: callers present a Bearer access token, which
# is validated against your IdP's JWKS. All three keys are required. jwks_url must be https (it is
# the trust anchor; a loopback host is allowed for local dev). audience is this daemon's own
# resource identifier as registered with the IdP, which is what stops a token minted for another
# relying party of the same issuer (including an OIDC ID token) from being replayed here.
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.provider=jwt
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.jwks_url=https://REPLACE_ME/.well-known/jwks.json
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.issuer=https://REPLACE_ME/
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.audience=REPLACE_ME
# Optional, defaults shown. Roles come from roles_claim (a space-delimited string or a string
# array); a value matching a role wire name (saga:read, saga:write, saga:admin) grants that role.
# Set token_type to at+jwt to require the RFC 9068 access-token `typ`, if your issuer stamps one.
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.principal_claim=sub
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.roles_claim=scope
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.jwt.token_type=at+jwt
#
# `apikey` is the alternative where there is no IdP: pre-shared keys, one block per key, secret and
# roles required. Each secret MUST be a secret reference, never an inline literal, so a key never
# sits in plaintext here. Uncomment this block instead of the jwt one.
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.provider=apikey
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.apikey.header=X-API-Key
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.apikey.key.writer.secret=${env:SAGA_WRITER_KEY}
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.apikey.key.writer.roles=saga:write
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.apikey.key.writer.principal=writer@example.com

# --- Local development only --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lets the daemon start under `noop` on a reachable interface. Short of binding host to a loopback
# address, this is the only way to do that, so it is also the shortest way past the startup failure
# described above. It removes the guard, not the exposure: every request is then served as a
# full-access administrator holding no credential. Use it on an isolated machine only; to
# authenticate callers, uncomment a provider block above instead.
# scalar.db.saga.server.security.insecure_mode.enabled=true

# --- Services a declarative step calls ---------------------------------------------------------
# One block per service named by a definition's "service" field. Only base_url is required; the
# service name is a config-local identifier and must not contain a dot.
# scalar.db.saga.server.service.payment.base_url=http://payment:8080
# Headers sent on every request to this service, one key per header. This is how a declarative step
# calls an AUTHENTICATED service, and the value takes a secret reference like any other key here.
# The engine stamps its own headers (X-Saga-Id, X-Saga-Step, X-Saga-Callback-Url) on every request
# and they always win, so naming one of them here is rejected at startup rather than ignored. Header
# names are case-insensitive, so setting one name in two spellings is rejected too. The value is
# trimmed, which is what lets a ${file:...} secret ending in a newline be sent as a header at all.
# The callback secret above is deliberately NOT trimmed — it is key material, not a header value.
# scalar.db.saga.server.service.payment.header.Authorization=${file:UTF-8:/run/secrets/payment-token}
# Per-service SSRF allowlist (comma-separated) and body cap. Matching is on host name only, so the
# allowlist is defense in depth for a trusted endpoint, not a sandbox.
# scalar.db.saga.server.service.payment.allowed_hosts=payment,payment.svc.cluster.local
# scalar.db.saga.server.service.payment.max_body_bytes=1048576

# --- Async callbacks ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The externally reachable base URL an async step hands a participant, and the HMAC secret that
# authenticates the participant's callback. Set both or neither: one without the other cannot
# complete an async step, so the daemon rejects it at startup instead of at the first async saga.
# scalar.db.saga.server.callback.base_url=https://REPLACE_ME
# scalar.db.saga.server.callback.secret=${env:SAGA_CALLBACK_SECRET}
# TTL on a callback token, so a leaked callback URL is not a non-expiring credential. 0 (default)
# disables the check; when set it must exceed the longest a step legitimately stays parked, or a
# genuine late callback is rejected.
# scalar.db.saga.server.callback.max_age_seconds=0

# --- Shutdown ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WAIT_CURRENT_STEP (default) finishes the running step and leaves the saga for recovery;
# WAIT_ALL_SAGAS waits for in-flight sagas to reach a terminal state and needs a timeout sized to
# your longest saga. This drain is the second of two shutdown windows the daemon spends in sequence
# — budget terminationGracePeriodSeconds for their sum (see docker/README.md).
# A timeout of 0 drains nothing: in-flight work is cancelled at once and left for the recovery scan
# on the next boot. That is a valid choice for a fast-restart deployment, not a disabled setting.
# scalar.db.saga.server.shutdown.mode=WAIT_CURRENT_STEP
# scalar.db.saga.server.shutdown.timeout_millis=30000

# --- Crash recovery ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every replica scans for sagas abandoned by a crashed instance and resumes them. timeout_millis is
# the staleness threshold and the one to get right: set it below the longest a HEALTHY instance goes
# between updating a saga and a live saga is stolen from the instance still running it.
# scalar.db.saga.server.recovery.timeout_millis=60000
# scalar.db.saga.server.recovery.interval_seconds=30
# How long a saga may stay stuck with failing compensation before it is escalated for manual
# intervention.
# scalar.db.saga.server.recovery.compensation_grace_period_seconds=14400
# Cap per pass, and how many of that batch run at once (which bounds a pass's database pressure).
# Keep batch_size well above store.recovery_scan_limit x the number of recoverable statuses, so one
# hot bucket cannot consume the whole budget.
# scalar.db.saga.server.recovery.batch_size=1000
# scalar.db.saga.server.recovery.max_concurrent_recoveries=10

# --- Retention ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purges terminal sagas so the tables do not grow without bound. period_seconds is also the window
# in which a finished saga's history can still be inspected. ESCALATED sagas are never purged —
# they await an operator. batch_size must keep up with the terminal-saga rate over one interval, or
# the backlog grows.
# scalar.db.saga.server.retention.period_seconds=604800
# scalar.db.saga.server.retention.cleanup_interval_seconds=60
# scalar.db.saga.server.retention.batch_size=10000
# scalar.db.saga.server.retention.max_concurrent_purges=10

# --- Bounds -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Left at defaults; see SagaServerConfig for the reasoning behind each.
# scalar.db.saga.server.sync.max_wait_millis=60000
# scalar.db.saga.server.sync.timeout_millis=0
# scalar.db.saga.server.default_saga_timeout_millis=0
# scalar.db.saga.server.max_start_requests_per_minute=0
