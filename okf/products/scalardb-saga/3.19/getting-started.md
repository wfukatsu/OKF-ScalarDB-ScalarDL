# Getting Started with ScalarDB Saga

This getting started tutorial explains how to run ScalarDB Saga as a server and illustrates the
process of running a sample order-placement flow, where placing an order charges a payment service,
reserves stock in an inventory service, and hands the parcel to a shipping service. The sample shows
how ScalarDB Saga completes the flow when every service succeeds, and how it automatically undoes the
completed steps when one of them fails.

> **Warning**
>
> Since the focus of the sample is to demonstrate using ScalarDB Saga, the participant services are
> stand-ins that return canned responses, and the server runs with authentication disabled. For
> details about running the server in production, see
> [server/docker/README.md](./server-deployment.md).

## Prerequisites for this sample application

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) 20.10 or later with
  [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) V2 or later
- `curl`, or any other HTTP client

No JDK is required. The saga server runs as a container and you drive it over HTTP.

## Clone the ScalarDB Saga repository

Open **Terminal**, then clone the ScalarDB Saga repository by running the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb-saga
```

Then, go to the directory that contains this sample by running the following command:

```console
cd scalardb-saga/getting-started
```

## Start the sample environment

Start the database, the participant services, and the saga server by running the following command:

```console
docker compose up -d --wait
```

`--wait` holds the command until the saga server reports healthy, so the requests below cannot race
its startup. That starts five containers:

| Container | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `postgres` | The database where the saga server keeps saga state |
| `payment`, `inventory`, `shipping` | The three services a saga calls |
| `saga-server` | ScalarDB Saga, serving REST on `12080` and gRPC on `12051` |

The saga server creates its tables in the database on first start, so there is no schema to load, and
registers the saga definitions in `conf/definitions`.

### Watch the participant services

The services print every request they receive and every response they return. Keep their logs in a
second terminal while you run sagas, so you can watch a saga drive them:

```console
docker compose logs -f payment inventory shipping
```

### Use a different database

This sample uses PostgreSQL because Compose can start it in one step, but saga state can live in any
database ScalarDB supports. To use another one, change the `scalar.db.*` properties in
`conf/server.properties`. For the list of supported databases, see
[Databases](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/requirements#databases).

## Saga definition details

Two saga definitions are registered from the `conf/definitions` directory. Each names its steps, the
call each step makes, and the call that undoes it:

- [`order-saga.json`](./reference/saga-definitions.md): the order flow, where every service succeeds

  | Step | Service | Execution | Compensation |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `charge` | `payment` | `POST /charge` | `POST /refund` |
  | `reserve` | `inventory` | `POST /reserve` | `POST /release` |
  | `ship` | `shipping` | `POST /ship` | `POST /cancel` |

- [`order-saga-failing.json`](./reference/saga-definitions.md): the same flow, except that
  `ship` calls `POST /ship-fail`, which the shipping service rejects with `422`

Values flow between the steps through the saga's context. A step's `jsonBody` reads from the context
with `${...}`, and its `output` captures fields from the service's response back into it, so a later
step can use them:

```json
{
  "name": "charge",
  "service": "payment",
  "execution": {
    "method": "POST", "path": "/charge",
    "jsonBody": { "orderId": "${orderId}", "amount": "${amount}" },
    "output": { "paymentId": "$.payment_id" }
  },
  "compensation": {
    "method": "POST", "path": "/refund",
    "jsonBody": { "orderId": "${orderId}" }
  }
}
```

Note that the compensation keys on `orderId`, which came from the request that started the saga,
rather than on the step's own output — a step that failed may not have produced one.

## Execute sagas and check their state in the sample application

The following sections describe how to run sagas and inspect them in the sample application.

### Place an order

Start with placing an order for two widgets by running the following command:

```console
curl -X POST localhost:12080/sagas \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sagaName":"order-saga","input":{"orderId":"o-1001","amount":"100","item":"widget","quantity":"2"}}'
```

You should see a similar output as below, with a different UUID for `sagaId` and different
timestamps, where `COMPLETED` confirms that every step succeeded:

```console
{"sagaId":"7f9c2a41-...","sagaName":"order-saga","status":"COMPLETED","definitionVersion":"1.0","createdAt":"2026-07-30T01:22:03.914Z","updatedAt":"2026-07-30T01:22:04.512Z"}
```

In the service logs, you should see the three steps running in order, each receiving values the saga
passed to it:

```console
[payment] POST /charge <- {"orderId":"o-1001","amount":"100"}
[payment] POST /charge -> 200 {"payment_id": "payment-o-1001"}
[inventory] POST /reserve <- {"orderId":"o-1001","item":"widget","quantity":"2"}
[inventory] POST /reserve -> 200 {"inventory_id": "inventory-o-1001"}
[shipping] POST /ship <- {"orderId":"o-1001","paymentId":"payment-o-1001","reservationId":"inventory-o-1001"}
[shipping] POST /ship -> 200 {"shipping_id": "shipping-o-1001"}
```

Note what the `ship` step received: `paymentId` is the value the payment service returned two steps
earlier, captured by that step's `output` and read back with `${paymentId}`. The fields are shown in
the order the definition declares them; the order they arrive in is not significant.

### Check the saga state

Get the current state of a saga by running the following command, replacing `<SAGA_ID_UUID>` with the
UUID for the `sagaId` that was shown after running the previous command:

```console
curl localhost:12080/sagas/<SAGA_ID_UUID>
```

You should see the same state as above. A saga is queryable while it is running and after it has
finished.

### Place an order that cannot be shipped

This is what a saga exists for. Place an order with the definition whose shipping step fails, by
running the following command:

```console
curl -X POST localhost:12080/sagas \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sagaName":"order-saga-failing","input":{"orderId":"o-1002","amount":"100","item":"widget","quantity":"2"}}'
```

You should see a similar output as below, where `COMPENSATED` shows that the failure was handled and
nothing was left half-applied:

```console
{"sagaId":"c41b8e07-...","sagaName":"order-saga-failing","status":"COMPENSATED","definitionVersion":"1.0","createdAt":"2026-07-30T01:24:11.208Z","updatedAt":"2026-07-30T01:24:12.377Z"}
```

In the service logs, you should see the shipping step rejected, and then every step compensated in
reverse order, starting with `ship` itself:

```console
[shipping] POST /ship-fail -> 422 {"error": "shipping rejected /ship-fail"}
[shipping] POST /cancel -> 200 {"shipping_id": "shipping-o-1002"}
[inventory] POST /release -> 200 {"inventory_id": "inventory-o-1002"}
[payment] POST /refund -> 200 {"payment_id": "payment-o-1002"}
```

Note that `ship` is compensated even though it failed. A step that reports a failure may still have
applied its side effect: the service can commit the change and then fail to answer, or the response
can be lost on the way back. The engine cannot tell that case apart from one where nothing happened,
so it compensates the failed step rather than assuming it did nothing. Compensations are required to
be idempotent, which is what makes the harmless case harmless; cancelling a shipment that was never
created must succeed.

A `422` is a permanent failure, so the step is not retried. A `503` or a connection error would be,
according to the step's retry policy.

### Check what the engine did

Get a saga's timeline — the durable record the engine writes as the saga progresses — by running
the following command:

```console
curl localhost:12080/sagas/<SAGA_ID_UUID>/detail
```

You should see the saga's state followed by its timeline, abridged here for readability:

```console
{"saga":{"sagaId":"c41b8e07-...","status":"COMPENSATED",...},
 "timeline":[{"timestamp":"...","type":"SAGA_STARTED"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_COMPLETED","stepIndex":0,"stepName":"charge"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_COMPLETED","stepIndex":1,"stepName":"reserve"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_FAILED","stepIndex":2,"stepName":"ship","detail":"..."},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"SAGA_COMPENSATING"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_COMPENSATED","stepIndex":2,"stepName":"ship"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_COMPENSATED","stepIndex":1,"stepName":"reserve"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"STEP_COMPENSATED","stepIndex":0,"stepName":"charge"},
             {"timestamp":"...","type":"SAGA_COMPENSATED","resultingStatus":"COMPENSATED"}]}
```

This record is what lets another server pick up a saga whose coordinator died mid-flight and finish
it. A step interrupted between running and being recorded runs again on recovery, which is why steps
must be idempotent. The timeline carries metadata and failure details only; raw step payloads are
never returned.

### Start a saga without waiting for it to finish

The commands above blocked until the saga reached a terminal state. Add `async=true` to get the saga
ID back immediately by running the following command:

```console
curl -X POST 'localhost:12080/sagas?async=true' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sagaName":"order-saga","input":{"orderId":"o-1003","amount":"100","item":"widget","quantity":"2"}}'
```

You should see a similar output as below, with `RUNNING` and a `202` status code, returned before the
saga has finished:

```console
{"sagaId":"9b3d5f18-...","sagaName":"order-saga","status":"RUNNING","definitionVersion":"1.0","createdAt":"2026-07-30T01:26:40.115Z","updatedAt":"2026-07-30T01:26:40.115Z"}
```

Then poll for the outcome by running the following command:

```console
curl localhost:12080/sagas/<SAGA_ID_UUID>
```

> **Note**
>
> The stand-in services answer instantly, so an asynchronous saga is usually already `COMPLETED` by
> the time you poll. To watch one in progress, set `DELAY_SECONDS: 3` on a service in
> `docker-compose.yaml` and run `docker compose up -d` again.

### Start a saga with your own ID

Supply your own saga ID instead of having one generated by running the following command:

```console
curl -X PUT localhost:12080/sagas/order-1001 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sagaName":"order-saga","input":{"orderId":"o-1004","amount":"100","item":"widget","quantity":"2"}}'
```

This makes starting a saga idempotent: if your application crashes without learning the outcome, it
can retry with the same ID instead of starting a second saga. Reusing an ID that already exists
returns `409`.

## Stop the sample environment

To stop the sample, stop the Docker containers and remove the database volume by running the following
command:

```console
docker compose down -v
```

To go further:

- Add a step, or a `retryPolicy`, to a definition, bump its `version`, then restart the server with
  `docker compose restart saga-server`. Definitions are immutable once registered, so editing one in
  place without bumping the version stops the server on its next start.
- Switch a definition to `"mode": "TCC"` to reserve every step before confirming any of them.
- [server/docker/README.md](./server-deployment.md) — running the server for real: configuration,
  authentication, health checks, and deployment.
- Embedded mode, listed in the [root README](./overview.md), runs the engine as a library inside your
  application, where steps can be Java code rather than service calls.

The Compose file pulls `ghcr.io/scalar-labs/scalardb-saga-server`, which is published from the first
release onward. To run against a locally built image instead, run `./gradlew :server:dockerBuild` from
the repository root, then run `docker compose up -d --wait` with `SAGA_VERSION` set to the `version`
in `gradle.properties`, which is the tag `dockerBuild` applies.
