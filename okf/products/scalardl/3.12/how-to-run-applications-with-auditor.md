# Run a ScalarDL Application Through ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor

This guide explains how to run a ScalarDL application through ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor. This document assumes that you have already tried one of the [Quickstart](./quickstart-overview.md) tutorials and created your application that integrates ScalarDL by using client SDKs by referring to the [Write an Application](./develop-write-an-application-overview.md) guides.

## What is ScalarDL Auditor?

ScalarDL Auditor is a component that manages the identical states of Ledger to help clients detect Byzantine faults. Using Auditor is beneficial from a security perspective, but it requires extra processing costs. Therefore, please carefully consider if it is necessary for your use case.

:::note

To make Byzantine fault detection work properly, Ledger and Auditor should be deployed and managed in different administrative domains. However, for the sake of simplicity in this guide, you'll use a simple configuration in the `scalardl-samples` environment, where both Ledger and Auditor are placed on the same network and managed within the same administrative domain.

:::

## Decide on configurations

Before running ScalarDL applications through Ledger and Auditor, you first need to configure Ledger, Auditor, and the client that interacts with ScalarDL.

There are several important options that you must set and decisions to make as described below.

### Enable Auditor

You must enable Auditor since you'll be running applications through Ledger and Auditor. Enabling Auditor has to be done in the configurations for the clients and Ledger as follows.

- In the client configuration, set `scalar.dl.client.auditor.enabled` to `true`.
- In the Ledger configuration, set `scalar.dl.ledger.auditor.enabled` to `true`.

Then, you must enable [Asset Proof](./how-to-write-applications.md#what-is-asset-proof) in the Ledger configuration by setting `scalar.dl.ledger.proof.enabled` to `true` since ScalarDL uses Asset Proofs to check for consistency between Ledger and Auditor. You also need to configure a proper private key or secret key in the Ledger and Auditor configurations to sign the Asset Proofs, depending on the authentication method chosen in the [Decide on an authentication method](#decide-on-an-authentication-method) section.

:::note

If you are using the `scalardl-samples` environment, see the `ledger.properties` and `auditor.properties` files for the corresponding storage.

:::

For details about the configurations, see the following:

- [Client configurations](./configurations.md#client-configurations)
- [Ledger configurations](./configurations.md#ledger-configurations)
- [Auditor configurations](./configurations.md#auditor-configurations)

### Decide on an authentication method

You must decide which authentication method to use for clients: digital signature or HMAC. As a simple comparison, the digital-signature method provides non-repudiation in addition to authentication but is slow, whereas the HMAC method provides only authentication but is fast.

You can configure an authentication method as follows. The same method (`digital-signature` or `hmac`) must be configured across the client, Ledger, and Auditor.

- In the client configuration, set `scalar.dl.client.authentication.method` to `digital-signature` or `hmac` (depending on which method you choose).
- In the Ledger configuration, set `scalar.dl.ledger.authentication.method` to `digital-signature` or `hmac` (depending on which method you choose).
- In the Auditor configuration, set `scalar.dl.auditor.authentication.method` to `digital-signature` or `hmac` (depending on which method you choose).

You also need to prepare some secret information. If you're using the digital-signature method, you need to prepare a certificate and a private key. If you're using the HMAC method, you need to prepare a secret key. For more details about authentication in ScalarDL, see the [ScalarDL Authentication Guide](./authentication.md).

For details about the configurations, see the following:

- [Client configurations](./configurations.md#client-configurations)
- [Ledger configurations](./configurations.md#ledger-configurations)
- [Auditor configurations](./configurations.md#auditor-configurations)

### Configure your database

Both Ledger and Auditor use ScalarDB to interact with databases, which enables you to run ScalarDL on top of various databases. So, you need to decide on a database that ScalarDB supports based on your applications' requirements and configure several ScalarDB parameters.

For details about the ScalarDB parameters, see [ScalarDB Configurations](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/configurations/).

#### Underlying database

You can configure which database to use in the Ledger and Auditor configurations by setting `scalar.db.storage`, `scalar.db.contact_points`, `scalar.db.username`, and `scalar.db.password` to the appropriate values based on the database that you'll be using.

For databases and their versions supported by ScalarDL via ScalarDB, see [Requirements](./requirements.md#databases).

:::warning

If your applications read and write a table through the Function feature, and the table is also directly accessed from ScalarDB applications, you need to properly configure the database chosen here. Specifically, both ScalarDL and ScalarDB applications must refer to the same Coordinator table to guarantee consistency.

:::

#### Isolation level

Ledger relies on the [Consensus Commit](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/consensus-commit/) transaction manager of ScalarDB to manage transactions. The transaction manager is responsible for guaranteeing the isolation property of transactions, which is crucial for ensuring the consistency and correctness of transactions.

You can configure the isolation level for Ledger in the Ledger configuration by setting `scalar.db.consensus_commit.isolation_level` to an isolation level of your choice. The default value is `SNAPSHOT`, but if you are unsure about which isolation level to use, use `SERIALIZABLE`.

:::note

Because Auditor does not rely on the Consensus Commit transaction manager, you do not have to configure the transaction manager or the isolation level for Auditor.

:::

#### Limitations

While ScalarDL leverages ScalarDB, the following ScalarDB features are not compatible with the consistency guarantee mechanism of ScalarDL:

- [Group commit for the Coordinator table](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/api-guide/#group-commit-for-the-coordinator-table) (`scalar.db.consensus_commit.coordinator.group_commit.enabled` must be `false`.)
- Coordinator write omission optimization in [Performance-related configurations](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/configurations#performance-related-configurations) (`scalar.db.consensus_commit.coordinator.write_omission_on_read_only.enabled` must be `false`.)

### Decide which other configurations to use

You can also apply other configurations, such as TLS and gRPC configurations, for the client, Ledger, and Auditor. For details about the configurations, see the following:

- [Client configurations](./configurations.md#client-configurations)
- [Ledger configurations](./configurations.md#ledger-configurations)
- [Auditor configurations](./configurations.md#auditor-configurations)

## Start Ledger and Auditor

After configuring Ledger, Auditor, and the client, you need to start up Ledger and Auditor.

This guide uses a container-based environment in `scalardl-samples` to locally start up Ledger and Auditor. If you have not finished cloning the repository, see [Prerequisites](./getting-started.md#prerequisites) and [Clone the ScalarDL samples repository](./getting-started.md#clone-the-scalardl-samples-repository).

For details on how to locally start up Ledger and Auditor in local or cloud-based Kubernetes environments, see [Deploy ScalarDL in your local Kubernetes environment](./deploy-local-environment-overview.md) or [Deploy ScalarDL in a cloud-based Kubernetes environment](./deploy-managed-kubernetes-environment-overview.md), respectively.

  scalardl-ledger:
    # image: ghcr.io/scalar-labs/scalardl-ledger:${SCALARDL_VERSION}
    image: ghcr.io/scalar-labs/scalardl-ledger-byol:${SCALARDL_VERSION}
```

2. Set your license key for ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor. In the `dynamodb/ledger.properties` and `dynamodb/auditor.properties` files, replace `<SET_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>` with your license key. For example:

```properties
##### PLEASE REPLACE THIS VALUE WITH YOUR LICENSE KEY (ENTERPRISE EDITION ONLY) #####
scalar.dl.licensing.license_key={"organization_name":"XXXXXXXX","expiration_date_time":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SS+TIMEZONE","product_name":"ScalarDL Ledger","product_version":N,"license_type":"trial","signature":"XXXXXXXX"}
##### PLEASE REPLACE THIS VALUE WITH YOUR LICENSE KEY (ENTERPRISE EDITION ONLY) #####
```

3. To validate the license by using a certificate, update the `dynamodb/docker-compose-ledger.yml` and `dynamodb/docker-compose-auditor.yml` files as follows. If you're using a trial license, skip this step.

   - Before changing the certificate file path (default configuration):

### Start up ScalarDL

You can start using ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor by following the steps below:

1. Run Cassandra locally by running the following command:

```console
docker compose -f cassandra/docker-compose-auditor.yml up -d cassandra
```

2. Load the database schema for ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor by running the following command:

docker compose -f cassandra/docker-compose-auditor.yml up -d scalardl-ledger-schema-loader
   docker compose -f cassandra/docker-compose-auditor.yml up -d scalardl-auditor-schema-loader
```

3. Run ScalarDL Ledger, Auditor, and its dependent components by running the following command:

```console
docker compose -f cassandra/docker-compose-auditor.yml up -d
```

## Set up authentication between Ledger and Auditor (digital signature authentication only)

When using digital signature authentication, you need to register the Ledger certificate and the Auditor certificate with each other. If you are using HMAC authentication, skip this step.

To register the Ledger and Auditor certificates, you need to run the client commands, which are included in the Client SDK. To get the Client SDK, see [Download the Client SDK](./getting-started.md#download-the-client-sdk). After downloading it, run the following commands:

```console
scalardl register-cert --properties <LEDGER_AS_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE>
scalardl register-cert --properties <AUDITOR_AS_CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE>
```

Specifically, in the `scalardl-samples` environment, you can register the certificates by running the following commands with the sample property files found in `./fixture/`:

```console
client/bin/scalardl register-cert --properties ./fixture/ledger.as.client.properties
client/bin/scalardl register-cert --properties ./fixture/auditor.as.client.properties
```

:::warning

Do not use the sample private key and certificate in production environments. For details about getting your own certificate, see [How to Get a Certificate](./ca/caclient-getting-started.md).

## Set up clients for the HashStore, TableStore, or Ledger abstractions

Depending on the abstraction that your application is based on (specifically, HashStore, TableStore, or Ledger), the setup instructions are different. Select an abstraction and follow the instructions.

**HashStore**

### Bootstrap HashStore clients

When creating `HashStoreClientService` in your application, the client certificate or secret key and the necessary contracts for using HashStore are automatically registered based on the configuration in `ClientConfig`. Thus, you don't have to manually bootstrap HashStore. If you would like to do it manually, for example, for testing purposes, download the HashStore Client SDK by following [Download the Client SDK](./getting-started-hashstore.md#download-the-client-sdk) and run the following command.

```console
scalardl-hashstore bootstrap --properties <CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE>
```

**TableStore**

### Bootstrap TableStore clients

When creating `TableStoreClientService` in your application, the client certificate or secret key and the necessary contracts for using TableStore are automatically registered based on the configuration in `ClientConfig`. Thus, you don't have to manually bootstrap TableStore. If you would like to do it manually, for example, for testing purposes, download the TableStore Client SDK by following [Download the Client SDK](./getting-started-tablestore.md#download-the-client-sdk) and run the following command.

```console
scalardl-tablestore bootstrap --properties <CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE>
```

**Ledger**

### Bootstrap Ledger clients

Register the client identity and system contracts by running the following `bootstrap` command:

```console
scalardl bootstrap --properties <CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE>
```

Specifically, in the `scalardl-samples` environment, you can use the command located at `client/bin/scalardl` with the sample property files found in `./fixture/` as follows.

```console
client/bin/scalardl bootstrap --properties ./fixture/client.properties
```

The bootstrap command registers the client certificate or secret key based on the authentication configuration done in [Decide on an authentication method](#decide-on-an-authentication-method).

You can also bootstrap by using [`ClientService`](https://javadoc.io/static/com.scalar-labs/scalardl-java-client-sdk/3.12.3/com/scalar/dl/client/service/ClientService.html) in the [ScalarDL Java Client SDK](./how-to-write-applications.md#use-the-scalardl-client-sdk).

### Register contracts and functions

You can register contracts by using the `register-contract` command.

```console
scalardl register-contract --properties <CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE> --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID> --contract-binary-name <CONTRACT_BINARY_NAME> --contract-class-file <CONTRACT_CLASS_FILE>
```

You can register functions by using the `register-function` command.

```console
scalardl register-function --properties <CLIENT_PROPERTIES_FILE> --function-id <FUNCTION_ID> --function-binary-name <FUNCTION_BINARY_NAME> --function-class-file <FUNCTION_CLASS_FILE>
```

You can also register contracts and functions by using [`ClientService`](https://javadoc.io/static/com.scalar-labs/scalardl-java-client-sdk/3.12.3/com/scalar/dl/client/service/ClientService.html) in the [ScalarDL Java Client SDK](./how-to-write-applications.md#use-the-scalardl-client-sdk).

## Run your application

Now that you have registered the necessary identities and contracts, you can run your application that integrates ScalarDL.
