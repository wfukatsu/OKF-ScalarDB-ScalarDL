# Monitor Overview

Monitoring is essential for maintaining the health and performance of your ScalarDL deployment. This section provides guidance on monitoring ScalarDL in Kubernetes cluster environments, including checking system availability, collecting time-series metrics, and viewing logs through monitoring dashboards.

:::note

ScalarDL uses ScalarDB for its data management and the Function feature, so you may experience a case where you're using both ScalarDL and ScalarDB in your deployment. In such a case, you may also want to monitor ScalarDB in addition to ScalarDL.
