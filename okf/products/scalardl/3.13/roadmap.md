# ScalarDL Roadmap

This roadmap provides a look into the proposed future of ScalarDL. The purpose of this roadmap is to provide visibility into what changes may be coming so that you can more closely follow progress, learn about key milestones, and give feedback during development. This roadmap will be updated as new versions of ScalarDL are released.

:::warning

During the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. **Do not schedule your release plans according to the contents of this roadmap.**

If you have a feature request or want to prioritize feature development, please create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardl/issues).

:::

### CY2026 Q2

#### Improvements

- **Coordinator log purging**
- ScalarDL will automatically purge coordinator logs after transactions are completed so that users can manage their storage in a more cost-effective way.

#### Usability

- **Enable read operations during a paused duration**
- Users will be able to issue read operations even during a paused duration so that they can still read data while taking backups.

#### Cloud support

- **Google Cloud Marketplace support for ScalarDL**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDL by using the Google Cloud Marketplace offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.

### CY2026 Q3

#### New capabilities

- **Lifecycle management for assets**
- Users will be able to better manage the lifecycle of assets, ensuring they are preserved securely for an extended period.

#### Improvements

- **Encryption**
- Users will be able to encrypt their data so that they can manage their data in a more secure way.
- **Elimination of out-of-memory errors due to large scans**
- Users will be able to issue large scans without experiencing out-of-memory errors.

#### Cloud support

- **Azure Marketplace support for ScalarDL**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDL by using the Azure Marketplace offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.
- **Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog integration for ScalarDL**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDL from Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog, which enables users to use ScalarDL as Red Hat-certified third-party products and services.

### CY2026 Q4

#### Improvements

- **Performance optimizations**
- Users will be able to execute requests faster so that they can create ScalarDL applications in a more cost-effective way.

### CY2026 Q4 -

- **Lazy validation**
- Users will be able to validate the authenticity of their data lazily so that they can manage their data in a cost-effective way if their data doesn't need to be validated in real time.

### CY2027

#### New capabilities

- **New execution engine**
- Users will be able to execute requests more efficiently, ensuring better performance and resource utilization.
