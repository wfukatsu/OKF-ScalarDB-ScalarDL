# ScalarDL Compatibility Matrix

This document shows the compatibility of ScalarDL Ledger and Auditor versions among ScalarDL Java Client SDK versions and ScalarDB Cluster.

:::note

Versions are expressed as `x.y.z`, where `x` represents the major version, `y` represents the minor version, and `z` represents the patch version. This format follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

:::

## ScalarDL compatibility with client SDKs

| ScalarDL Ledger/Auditor version | ScalarDL Java Client SDK version |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| 3.13                            | 3.10 - 3.13                      |
| 3.12                            | 3.10 - 3.12                      |
| 3.11                            | 3.10 - 3.11                      |
| 3.10                            | 3.10                             |

:::note

- The client tools ([ScalarDL Client Command](./scalardl-command-reference.md) and [ScalarDL Schema Loader](./schema-loader.md)), and the Java Client SDKs for [ScalarDL HashStore](./getting-started-hashstore.md) and [ScalarDL TableStore](./getting-started-tablestore.md) are equivalent to the ScalarDL Java Client SDK, so the same compatibility rules apply to each of them.
- When you create a new deployment of ScalarDL, using the same version of ScalarDL Schema Loader as the version of ScalarDL is recommended.
- When you upgrade the minor or patch version of ScalarDL, basically, you don't need to update the existing schemas. In other words, basically, you don't need to re-run ScalarDL Schema Loader when you upgrade a minor or patch version of ScalarDL.
- If you use a new feature that ScalarDL provides in a new minor version, you may need to use the same or a later version of the client tools or re-create (or update) existing schemas. For details, please refer to the relevant documentation about each feature.
- For Scalar Admin and Scalar Admin for Kubernetes, using the latest versions of these tools is recommended to ensure compatibility with the version of ScalarDL that you are using.

### Version skew policy

- If the **major** versions are different between ScalarDL and the client SDK, they are **not** compatible and are **not** supported.
- If the **major** versions are the same and the **minor** versions are different between ScalarDL and the client SDK, the version of ScalarDL must be greater than or equal to the client SDK version. For example:
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDL 3.13 and client SDK 3.11
  - **Not supported:** Combination of ScalarDL 3.11 and client SDK 3.13
- If the **major** versions and the **minor** versions are the same, you can use different **patch** versions between ScalarDL and the client SDK. For example:
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDL 3.13.2 and client SDK 3.13.0
  - **Supported:** Combination of ScalarDL 3.13.0 and client SDK 3.13.2

## ScalarDL compatibility with ScalarDB Cluster

If you use ScalarDB Cluster with ScalarDL, you can use the following combinations of versions.

| ScalarDL version | ScalarDB Cluster version                                      |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.13             | 3.17 or later minor (3.X) version (like 3.17, 3.18, and 3.19) |
| 3.12             | 3.16 or later minor (3.X) version (like 3.16, 3.17, and 3.18) |
| 3.11             | 3.15 or later minor (3.X) version (like 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17) |
| 3.10             | 3.14 or later minor (3.X) version (like 3.14, 3.15, and 3.16) |
