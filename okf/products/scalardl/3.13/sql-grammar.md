# ScalarDL TableStore SQL Grammar

This page provides a list of commands supported in ScalarDL TableStore SQL.

:::note

ScalarDL TableStore SQL is a [PartiQL-based](https://partiql.org/) language and is not fully compatible with standard SQL.

:::

- DDL
  - [CREATE TABLE](#create-table)
- DML
  - [SELECT](#select)
  - [INSERT](#insert)
  - [UPDATE](#update)
- Others
  - [Show tables](#show-tables)
  - [Show record histories](#show-record-histories)
- Literal
  - [String](#string)
  - [Number](#number)
  - [Boolean](#boolean)

## DDL

Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables.

### CREATE TABLE

The `CREATE TABLE` command creates a table.

#### Grammar

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> (
  <primary key column name> data_type PRIMARY KEY [, <index key column name> data_type,] ...
)

data_type: BOOLEAN | INT | BIGINT | FLOAT | DOUBLE PRECISION | STRING
```

#### Notes

- You don't have to specify a strict schema when creating a table, but you must specify a primary key column at least.
- You can create secondary indexes by specifying index key columns.
- ScalarDL TableStore handles all numeric data types (`INT`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, and `DOUBLE PRECISION`) as the `NUMBER` data type in the JSON format without distinguishing them.

#### Examples

An example of `CREATE TABLE` is as follows:

```sql
-- Create a table with a primary key ("c1") and index keys ("c2", "c3", and "c4").
CREATE TABLE tbl (
  c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
  c2 STRING,
  c3 FLOAT,
  c4 BIGINT
);
```

## DML

Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to query and modify data in tables.

### SELECT

The `SELECT` command retrieves records in tables managed by TableStore.

#### Grammar

```sql
SELECT projection [, projection] ...
  FROM <table name> [AS <alias>] [join_specification [join_specification] ...]
  WHERE predicate [AND predicate ...]

projection: * | identifier
join_specification: JOIN <table name> [AS <alias>] ON join_predicate
join_predicate: identifier = identifier
predicate: identifier operator <literal> | identifier IS [NOT] NULL
identifier: [<table name>.]<column name> | [alias.]<column name>
operator: = | <> | != | > | >= | < | <=
```

##### Notes

- For the `SELECT` clause, you can specify top-level fields in the JSON record object as projection columns.
- For the `JOIN` clause, the `join_predicate`s must include either a primary-key column or index-key column from the right table.
- For the `WHERE` clause, you can specify predicates for any columns, but you must include at least one predicate for a primary key column or index key column with the equality condition or `IS NULL` condition.

#### Examples

If you have the following table with the primary and index keys, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (
  c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
  c2 STRING,
  c3 FLOAT,
  c4 BIGINT
);
```

Examples of `SELECT` are as follows:

```sql
-- With a primary key
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c1 = 10;

-- With a primary key and predicates for non-primary-key columns
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c1 = 10 AND c2 = 'aaa' AND c3 = 1.23 AND c4 < 100;

-- With projections and a primary key
SELECT c1, c2, c3, c5 FROM tbl WHERE c1 = 10;

-- With an equality predicate for an indexed column
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c4 = 100;

-- With an equality predicate for an indexed column and predicates for non-key columns
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c4 = 100 AND c5 = false;

-- With IS NULL predicates
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE c2 IS NULL AND c3 IS NOT NULL;

-- With JOIN clause
SELECT * FROM tbl1 as t1 JOIN tbl2 as t2 on t1.c2=t2.id WHERE t1.c1=1;
```

### INSERT

The `INSERT` command inserts a new record into the specified table. If the target record already exists, an exception will be thrown. In ScalarDL TableStore, a record is represented by a JSON object. You can also specify the JSON object by using the PartiQL struct format.

#### Grammar

```sql
INSERT INTO <table name> VALUES record_specification

record_specification: `<JSON object>` | <PartiQL struct>
```

##### Notes

You must include a primary key column in the record to be inserted.

#### Examples

Examples of `INSERT` are as follows:

```sql
-- Insert a record using the JSON format
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES `{"c1": 10, "c2": "aaa", "c3": 1.23, "c4": 100, "c5": true}`;

-- Insert a record using the PartiQL struct format
INSERT INTO tbl VALUES {'c1': 10, 'c2': 'aaa', 'c3': 1.23, 'c4': 100, 'c5': true};
```

### UPDATE

The `UPDATE` command updates existing records in the specified table. You can specify conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter records, the same as the `SELECT` command. Still, you must include at least one predicate for a primary key column or index key column with the equality condition or `IS NULL` condition.

#### Grammar

```sql
UPDATE <table name>
  SET <column name> = <literal> [, <column name> = <literal>] ...
  WHERE predicate [AND predicate ...]

predicate: <column name> operator <literal> | <column name> IS [NOT] NULL
operator: = | <> | != | > | >= | < | <=
```

##### Notes

- For the `SET` clause, if the specified column does not exist in the records, then it is newly added in the JSON object of the records.
- For the `WHERE` clause, you can specify predicates for any columns, but you must include at least one predicate for a primary key column or index key column with the equality condition or `IS NULL` condition.

#### Examples

If you have the following table, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (
  c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
  c2 STRING,
  c3 FLOAT,
  c4 BIGINT
);
```

Examples of `UPDATE` with the full primary key specified are as follows:

```sql
-- Update a record with a primary key predicate
UPDATE tbl SET c4 = 200, c5 = false WHERE c1 = 10;

-- Update a record with an index key predicate
UPDATE tbl SET c4 = 200, c5 = false WHERE c2 = 'aaa';

-- Update a record with a primary key and a non-key predicate
UPDATE tbl SET c4 = 200, c5 = false WHERE c1 = 10 AND c5 = true;
```

## Others

This section covers additional commands and functions that extend beyond the standard DDL and DML categories.

### Show tables

You can show tables managed by TableStore by querying the `information_schema.tables` table.

#### Grammar

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM information_schema.tables
  [WHERE table_name = <table name>]
```

#### Examples

Examples of querying the `information_schema.tables` table are as follows:

```sql
-- Show all tables in tables managed by TableStore.
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;

-- Show only the specified table
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tbl';
```

### Show record histories

You can show a history of the specified record by using the `history()` function.

#### Grammar

```sql
SELECT history()
  FROM <table name>
  WHERE predicate
  [LIMIT <limit>]

predicate: <column name> = <literal>
```

#### Notes

- You must specify a primary key in the `WHERE` clause.
- The command returns the records sorted from latest to oldest.
- With the `LIMIT` clause, the command returns the most recent `<limit>` rows sorted from latest to oldest.

#### Examples

Examples of showing a history of the specified record are as follows:

```sql
-- Show a history of the specified record
SELECT history() FROM tbl WHERE c1 = 10;

-- Show a history of the specified record with limit
SELECT history() FROM tbl WHERE c1 = 10 LIMIT 10;
```

## Literal

Literal refers to a fixed data value used when writing SQL statements. For example, `1`, `'abc'`, `1.23`, and `true` are literals.

### String

A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes `'`, such as `'abc'` and `'abc def'`.

### Number

Number literals include exact-value (`INTEGER` and `BIGINT`) and approximate-value (`FLOAT` and `DOUBLE PRECISION`) literals:

- An exact-value literal is a sequence of digits, such as `123` and `-5`.
- An approximate-value literal is a sequence of digits with a decimal point, such as `4.754` and `-1.2`.

### Boolean

Boolean literals are either `true` or `false` to represent boolean values.
