# ScalarDB 3.12 Release Notes

This page includes a list of release notes for ScalarDB 3.12.

## v3.12.3

**Release date:** July 3, 2024

### Summary

This release includes several improvements, bug fixes, and vulnerability fixes.

### Community edition

#### Improvements

- Refactored scan with filtering. ([#1715](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1715))
- Changed the hard-coded password for the Oracle user to a more secure one in the JDBC adapter. ([#1765](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1765))
- Update base image of container image. This update fixes an OOM issue on a Kubernetes with cgroup v2 environment. In the previous versions, if you use a Kubernetes cluster with cgroup v2, you might face an OOM-killed issue. ([#1826](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1826))

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where `NullPointerException` occurs during the `EXTRA_READ` validation when scanning records in a transaction, but some of them are deleted by other transactions. ([#1624](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1624))
- Fixed a bug where lazy recovery was not executed for the implicit pre-read of put and delete operations. ([#1681](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1681))
- Fixed a bug where users could see inconsistent results when scanning records by an index key after putting the related records in Consensus Commit transactions. ([#1727](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1727))
- Upgraded `grpc_health_probe` to fix security issues. [CVE-2024-24790](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-49gw-vxvf-fc2g "CVE-2024-24790"), [CVE-2023-45283](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vvjp-q62m-2vph "CVE-2023-45283"), and [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288") ([#1980](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1980))
- Fixed snapshot management issues. ([#1976](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/1976))
- Fix a bug of the import-table feature that it could access tables in other namespace that have the same table name when using MySQL storage. For example, in the following situation, the metadata of the columns `pk_unexpected` and `col_unexpected` of `ns2.tbl1` are handled and the import-table feature fails due to unsupported data types. ([#2001](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/2001))
