# Getting Started with Distributed Transactions in the ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK

The ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK supports the distributed transaction functionality of ScalarDB Cluster. The SDK includes transaction and manager abstractions for easier communication within a cluster.

:::note

Although we recommend using asynchronous methods as in the following examples, you can use synchronous versions instead.

:::

For details about distributed SQL transactions, see [Getting Started with Distributed SQL Transactions in the ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK](./getting-started-with-distributed-sql-transactions.md).

## Install the SDK

Install the same major and minor version of the [SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScalarDB.Client) as ScalarDB Cluster into the .NET project. You can do this by using the built-in NuGet package manager, replacing `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` with the version that you're using:

```console
dotnet add package ScalarDB.Client --version '<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.*'
```

## Create a settings file

Create a `scalardb-options.json` file and add the following, replacing `<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>` with the FQDN or the IP address, and `<PORT>` with the port number (`60053` by default) of your cluster:

```json
{
  "ScalarDbOptions": {
    "Address": "http://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>",
    "HopLimit": 10
  }
}
```

For details about settings files and other ways to configure the client, see [Client configuration](./common-reference.md#client-configuration).

## Get a transaction manager

You need to get a transaction manager for distributed transactions. To get the transaction manager, you can use `TransactionFactory` as follows:

```c#
// Pass the path to the settings file created in the previous step.
var factory = TransactionFactory.Create("scalardb-options.json");

using var manager = factory.GetTransactionManager();
```

## Manage transactions

To execute multiple CRUD operations as part of a single transaction, first, you need to begin a transaction. You can begin a transaction by using the transaction manager as follows:

```c#
var transaction = await manager.BeginAsync();
```

You can also resume a transaction that is already being executed as follows:

```c#
var transaction = manager.Resume(transactionIdString);
```

:::note

The `Resume` method doesn't have an asynchronous version because it only creates a transaction object. Because of this, resuming a transaction by using the wrong ID is possible.

:::

### Begin a read-only transaction

If you perform only read operations (that is, `GetAsync` and `ScanAsync`) in a transaction, you can begin a read-only transaction as follows:

```c#
var transaction = await manager.BeginReadOnlyAsync();
```

:::note

Read-only transactions are optimized for read operations only. Attempting to perform write operations (`InsertAsync`, `UpsertAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, `DeleteAsync`, `MutateAsync`, or `BatchAsync` with write operations) in a read-only transaction will result in an error.

:::

When a transaction is ready to be committed, you can call the `CommitAsync` method of the transaction as follows:

```c#
await transaction.CommitAsync();
```

To roll back the transaction, you can use the `RollbackAsync` method:

```c#
await transaction.RollbackAsync();
```

## Execute CRUD operations

A transaction has `GetAsync`, `ScanAsync`, `InsertAsync`, `UpsertAsync`, `UpdateAsync`, `DeleteAsync`, and `MutateAsync` methods to execute CRUD operations against the cluster. As a parameter, these methods have an operation object. An operation object can be created by using the builders listed in this section.

:::note

CRUD operations can be executed in a one-shot transaction manner without needing to explicitly create a transaction. For that, a manager object has the same CRUD methods as a transaction object.

:::

To use builders, add the following namespace to the `using` section:

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Builders;
```

:::note

The cluster does not support parallel execution of commands inside one transaction, so make sure to use `await` for asynchronous methods.

:::

### `GetAsync` method example

To retrieve a single record, you can use the `GetAsync` method as follows:

```c#
var get =
    new GetBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .SetProjections("item_id", "count")
        .Build();

var getResult = await transaction.GetAsync(get);
```

It is possible to retrieve a record by using an index instead of a partition key. To do that, you need to set the type of operation to `GetWithIndex` as follows:

```c#
// ...
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var get =
    new GetBuilder()
        // ...
        .SetGetType(GetOperationType.GetWithIndex)
        .AddPartitionKey("index_column", "1")
        .Build();
```

You can also specify arbitrary conditions that a retrieved record must meet, or it won't be returned. The conditions can be set as conjunctions of conditions as follows:

```c#
var get =
    new GetBuilder()
        // ...
        .AddConjunction(c => c.AddCondition("cost", 1000, Operator.LessThan))
        .AddConjunction(c =>
        {
            c.AddCondition("cost", 10000, Operator.LessThan);
            c.AddCondition("in_stock", true, Operator.Equal);
        })
        .Build();
```

In the above example, a record will be returned only if its `cost` is less than `1000`, or if its `cost` is less than `10000` and `in_stock` is true.

#### Handle `IResult` objects

The `GetAsync` and `ScanAsync` methods return `IResult` objects. An `IResult` object contains columns of the retrieved record. The value of the specific column can be retrieved in the following manner:

```c#
// Getting an integer value from the "item_id" column.
// If it fails, an exception will be thrown.
var itemId = result.GetValue<int>("item_id");

// Trying to get a string value from the "order_id" column.
// If it fails, no exception will be thrown.
if (result.TryGetValue<string>("order_id", out var orderId))
    Console.WriteLine($"order_id: {orderId}");

// Checking if the "count" column is null.
if (result.IsNull("count"))
    Console.WriteLine("'count' is null");
```

For details about which type should be used in `GetValue<T>` and `TryGetValue<T>`, see [How ScalarDB Column Types Are Converted to and from .NET Types](./common-reference.md#how-scalardb-column-types-are-converted-to-and-from-net-types).

### `ScanAsync` method example

To retrieve a range of records, you can use the `ScanAsync` method as follows:

```c#
var scan =
    new ScanBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddStartClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .SetStartInclusive(true)
        .AddEndClusteringKey("item_id", 8)
        .SetEndInclusive(true)
        .SetProjections("item_id", "count")
        .Build();

var scanResult = await transaction.ScanAsync(scan);
```

It is possible to retrieve a record by using an index instead of a partition key. To do that, you need to set the type of operation to `ScanWithIndex` as follows:

```c#
// ...
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var scan =
    new ScanBuilder()
        // ...
        .SetScanType(ScanOperationType.ScanWithIndex)
        .AddPartitionKey("index_column", "1")
        .Build();
```

The arbitrary conditions that a retrieved record must meet can also be set for a scan operation in the same way as for a [get operation](./getting-started-with-distributed-transactions.md#getasync-method-example).

### Use a scanner to retrieve large datasets

The `ScanAsync` method returns all results at once, which can be memory intensive for large datasets. To handle large datasets more efficiently, you can use a scanner that streams results from the cluster and enables incremental processing.

#### Create a scanner

You can create a scanner from a transaction by using the `CreateScannerAsync` method:

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Builders;
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var scan = new ScanBuilder()
    .SetNamespaceName("ns")
    .SetTableName("items")
    .SetScanType(ScanOperationType.ScanAll)
    .Build();

await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scan);
```

:::note

The scanner must be disposed of after use to release server-side resources. If the scanner's lifetime is limited to a single scope, use `await using` (or `using` for synchronous code) for automatic cleanup. If you need to return a scanner from a method or manage its lifetime across multiple scopes, call `DisposeAsync()` (or `Dispose()`) explicitly when done.

:::

#### Retrieve results one by one

Use the `OneAsync` method to retrieve results one at a time:

```c#
await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scan);

while (true)
{
    var result = await scanner.OneAsync();
    if (result == null)
        break;

    // Process the result.
    var itemId = result.GetValue<int>("item_id");
    Console.WriteLine($"Item ID: {itemId}");
}
```

If there are no more results, `OneAsync` returns `null`. Subsequent calls to `OneAsync` after receiving `null` will continue to return `null`.

#### Retrieve all remaining results

Use the `AllAsync` method to retrieve all remaining results at once:

```c#
await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scan);

var results = await scanner.AllAsync();
foreach (var result in results)
{
    // Process each result.
    var itemId = result.GetValue<int>("item_id");
    Console.WriteLine($"Item ID: {itemId}");
}
```

:::note

If you have already retrieved some results by using `OneAsync`, the `AllAsync` method will return only the remaining results that have not yet been retrieved.

:::

#### Configure scanner fetch size

You can configure the default fetch size for scanner operations by using `ScalarDbOptions`. The fetch size determines how many records are fetched from the server in each batch:

```c#
var scalarDbOptions = new ScalarDbOptions
{
    Address = "http://<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>",
    ScannerFetchSize = 20  // Default is 10.
};
```

#### Use a scanner with scan options

The scanner supports all scan options available in `ScanBuilder`.

##### Scan with limit

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Builders;
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var scanWithLimit = new ScanBuilder()
    .SetNamespaceName("ns")
    .SetTableName("items")
    .SetScanType(ScanOperationType.ScanAll)
    .SetLimit(100)  // Limit to 100 results.
    .Build();

await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scanWithLimit);
var results = await scanner.AllAsync();
```

##### Scan with clustering key range

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Builders;
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var scanWithRange = new ScanBuilder()
    .SetNamespaceName("ns")
    .SetTableName("statements")
    .SetScanType(ScanOperationType.Scan)
    .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
    .AddStartClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
    .SetStartInclusive(true)
    .AddEndClusteringKey("item_id", 8)
    .SetEndInclusive(true)
    .Build();

await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scanWithRange);
```

#### Close the scanner

The scanner implements both `IDisposable` and `IAsyncDisposable`. The recommended approach is to use `await using` (or `using` for synchronous code) for automatic disposal:

```c#
await using var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scan);
// The scanner is automatically closed when leaving the scope.
```

If you need to close the scanner explicitly, you can use the `CloseAsync` method:

```c#
var scanner = await transaction.CreateScannerAsync(scan);
try
{
    var result = await scanner.OneAsync();
    // Process result...
}
finally
{
    await scanner.CloseAsync();
}
```

#### Synchronous API

All scanner methods have synchronous versions:

```c#
using var scanner = transaction.CreateScanner(scan);

// Retrieve one result.
var result = scanner.One();

// Retrieve all remaining results.
var results = scanner.All();

// Close the scanner.
scanner.Close();
```

#### Scanner vs. ScanAsync

| Feature | Scanner | ScanAsync |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Memory usage | Low (streaming) | Higher (all results in memory) |
| Use case | Large datasets | Small to medium datasets |
| Result retrieval | Incremental (`OneAsync`) or all at once (`AllAsync`) | All at once |
| Resource management | Requires explicit disposal | Automatic |

:::note

For details on handling exceptions during scanner and other transaction operations, see [Exception Handling in the ScalarDB Cluster .NET Client SDK](./exception-handling.md).

:::

### `InsertAsync` method example

To insert a new record, you can use the `InsertAsync` method as follows:

```c#
var insert =
    new InsertBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .AddColumn("count", 11)
        .Build();

await transaction.InsertAsync(insert);
```

### `UpsertAsync` method example

To upsert a record (update an existing record or insert a new one), you can use the `UpsertAsync` method as follows:

```c#
var upsert =
    new UpsertBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .AddColumn("count", 11)
        .Build();

await transaction.UpsertAsync(upsert);
```

### `UpdateAsync` method example

To update an existing record, you can use the `UpdateAsync` method as follows:

```c#
// ...
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var update =
    new UpdateBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .AddColumn("count", 11)
        .AddCondition("processed", false, Operator.Equal)
        .Build();

await transaction.UpdateAsync(update);
```

### `DeleteAsync` method example

To delete a record, you can use the `DeleteAsync` method as follows:

```c#
// ...
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var delete =
    new DeleteBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .AddCondition("processed", false, Operator.Equal)
        .Build();

await transaction.DeleteAsync(delete);
```

### `MutateAsync` method example

The `MutateAsync` method allows you to execute more than one mutation operation in a single call to the cluster. You can do this in the following manner:

```c#
// ...
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var mutations = new IMutation[]
                {
                    new InsertBuilder()
                        // ...
                        .Build(),
                    new UpsertBuilder()
                        // ...
                        .Build(),
                    new UpdateBuilder()
                        // ...
                        .Build(),
                    new DeleteBuilder()
                        // ...
                        .Build()
                };

await transaction.MutateAsync(mutations);
```

### `BatchAsync` method example

The `BatchAsync` method allows you to execute multiple operations, including both read and write operations, in a single request. This can improve performance by reducing network round trips. You can use this method as follows:

```c#
using ScalarDB.Client.Core;

// ...

var operations = new IOperation[]
{
    new GetBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "1")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 2)
        .Build(),
    new ScanBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "2")
        .Build(),
    new InsertBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "3")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 1)
        .AddColumn("count", 5)
        .Build(),
    new DeleteBuilder()
        .SetNamespaceName("ns")
        .SetTableName("statements")
        .AddPartitionKey("order_id", "4")
        .AddClusteringKey("item_id", 1)
        .Build()
};

var results = await transaction.BatchAsync(operations);
```

The results are returned in the same order as the input operations. You can inspect each result by using the type-checking properties as follows:

```c#
for (var i = 0; i < results.Count; i++)
{
    var result = results[i];

    if (result.IsGetResult)
    {
        // GetResult is null if the record was not found.
        if (result.GetResult != null)
        {
            var count = result.GetResult.GetValue<int>("count");
        }
    }
    else if (result.IsScanResult)
    {
        foreach (var record in result.ScanResults)
        {
            var itemId = record.GetValue<int>("item_id");
        }
    }
    else if (result.IsInsertResult || result.IsUpsertResult
             || result.IsUpdateResult || result.IsDeleteResult)
    {
        // Mutation operations don't return data.
    }
}
```

The supported operation types for `BatchAsync` are `Get`, `Scan`, `Insert`, `Upsert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.
