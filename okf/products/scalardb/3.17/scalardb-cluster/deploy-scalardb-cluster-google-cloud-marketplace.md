   ![Pending approval in the Scalar portal](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/pending-approval-scalar-portal.png)

   After your request has been approved, you will get an email with the title **Your ScalarDB Enterprise Edition - [EDITION_NAME] subscription request approved** from the following email address: marketplace-notifications@scalar-labs.com. Also, after your request has been approved, the **Subscribe** button on the **Cloud Accounts** page of the Scalar portal will be grayed out.

   ![Grayed out subscribe button](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/grayed-out-subscribe-button.png)

1. On the **Cloud Accounts** page, enter the **Project ID** and **Project number** of your Google Cloud project that you want to use for the ScalarDB Cluster deployment. You can use the default values for the other configurations like **Subscription**, **Cloud Provider**, and **Account Configuration Method**. After you enter the **Project ID** and **Project number**, select the **Create** button.

   ![Enter project ID and project number](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/enter-project-id-and-project-number.png)

1. When the **Account Configuration Instructions** pop-up window is displayed, copy the bash command and select the link **Google Cloud Shell** to open the Google Cloud Shell.

   ![Account configuration instructions](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/account-configuration-instructions.png)

1. In the Google Cloud Shell, paste the bash command that you copied in the **Account Configuration Instructions** pop-up window and execute the command. You will be asked **Do you want to proceed?**, like in the example output below. Enter **yes**.

```console
=============================================
      Google Cloud Setup Script
=============================================
This script will configure your GCP project.
✔ Enable required GCP APIs
✔ Create & configure service accounts
✔ Assign IAM roles
✔ Setup Workload Identity Pool and OIDC Provider
-----------------------------------------------
Do you want to proceed? (yes/no):
```

   If the bash command is successful, a message like the following will be displayed.

```console
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - [INFO] - Script completed successfully.
```

1. On the **Cloud Accounts** page in the Scalar portal, the status will be **Ready**.

   ![Cloud account lifecycle status ready](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/cloud-account-lifecycle-status-ready.png)

1. In the sidebar navigation, select **Instances**. Then, select the **Create** button on the **Deployment Instances** screen.

   ![Deployment instance create](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/deployment-instance-create.png)

1. On the **Create Deployment Instance** page, enter the configurations as follows:

   - **Subscription Plan:** Select the edition that you subscribed to.
   - **Subscription:** Use the default value. (You don't need to update this value.)
   - **Cloud Provider:** Use the default value. (You don't need to update this value.)
   - **Region:** Select the region that you want to deploy ScalarDB Cluster in.
   - **Tags:** Set any arbitrary tags.
   - **Network Type:** Select **Public**.
   - **Cloud Provider Account Config ID:** Select your cloud account that you previously registered on the **Cloud Accounts** page.
   - **ScalarDB Cluster Node Replica Count:** Enter the number of ScalarDB Cluster node replicas.
   - **Database Properties:** Enter the ScalarDB Cluster properties. For details, please see [ScalarDB Cluster Configurations](./scalardb-cluster-configurations.md).
   - **Database Properties (Sensitive Information):** Enter the ScalarDB Cluster properties, like `scalar.db.username` and `scalar.db.password`. These values are invisible in the Scalar portal after you deploy ScalarDB Cluster.

     :::note

     In this text box, you can enter (copy and paste) the properties in the same format as normal database properties. For example:

```properties
scalar.db.username=<USERNAME>
scalar.db.password=<PASSWORD>
```

     These values are automatically masked when you enter them into this text box.

     :::

   Example:

   ![Create deployment instance](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/create-deployment-instance.png)

1. After you enter the configurations for your deployment, select the **Create** button. The **Launching Your Instance** pop-up window will be displayed.

   ![Launching your instance](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/launching-your-instance.png)

1. After your instance has been launched, your deployed instance will be displayed with **Lifecycle Status** as **Running**.

   ![Deployed your instance](https://scalardb.scalar-labs.com/docs/3.17/scalardb-cluster/images/google-marketplace/deployed-your-instance.png)

   :::note

   Deploying a new instance will take time. In particular, if this is the first time that your ScalarDB Cluster instance is deployed to the region that you selected, a GKE cluster will be created first, which will take a significant amount of time.

   :::

1. To see the endpoint information to access the ScalarDB Cluster endpoint and the Grafana dashboard, select an instance under **Instance ID** and go to the **Connectivity** tab.
