This page includes a list of release notes for ScalarDB 3.15.

## v3.15.9

**Release date:** August 2, 2026

### Summary

This release updates the deprecation policy for both Community and Enterprise editions, fixes transaction abort, rollback, pause, and metadata cache invalidation issues, and upgrades several dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

### Community edition

#### Improvements

- Changed the deprecation policy so that APIs and configurations marked as deprecated will now be removed in 4.0.0 instead of 5.0.0. ([#3520](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3520))

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where aborting an in-flight, group-committed transaction by ID via `DistributedTransactionManager.rollback(String)` / `abort(String)` could be lost when the Coordinator group commit feature was enabled. ([#3619](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3619))

### Enterprise edition

#### Improvements

##### ScalarDB Cluster

- Changed the deprecation policy so that APIs marked as deprecated will now be removed in 4.0.0 instead of 5.0.0.

#### Bug fixes

##### ScalarDB Cluster

- Fixed a bug where a `rollback` that exceeded the cluster's request-forwarding hop limit was silently reported as successful instead of surfacing the failure, which could leave records prepared until lazy recovery.
- Fixed a race condition where pausing a cluster node or the Transaction Coordinator could report success while the node remained unpaused. This could happen when an unpause or another pause request was issued concurrently, and also when a pause that waits for outstanding requests timed out after an earlier pause had already succeeded.
- Upgraded the Jackson and Netty libraries to fix security issues: [CVE-2026-42579](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cm33-6792-r9fm), [CVE-2026-42583](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mj4r-2hfc-f8p6), [CVE-2026-42584](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57rv-r2g8-2cj3), [CVE-2026-42587](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f6hv-jmp6-3vwv), [CVE-2026-44249](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3qp7-7mw8-wx86), [CVE-2026-45416](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x4gw-5cx5-pgmh), [CVE-2026-45674](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-676x-f7gg-47vc), [CVE-2026-47691](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5pvg-856g-cp85), [CVE-2026-50010](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c653-97m9-rcg9), [CVE-2026-54512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3rv-43j4-c7qm), [CVE-2026-54513](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rmj7-2vxq-3g9f), [CVE-2026-55831](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6jqx-86gh-f27w), [CVE-2026-55833](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mvh2-crg5-v77c), [CVE-2026-56745](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jppx-w49h-x2qq), [CVE-2026-59901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-558v-64gr-wgg4), and [GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9)

##### ScalarDB SQL

- Fixed an issue where `CachedMetadata#invalidateNamespaceNamesCache()` did not actually invalidate the cached list of namespaces, causing `SHOW NAMESPACES` and related operations to potentially return stale results until the cache TTL expired.

## v3.15.8

**Release date:** April 15, 2026

### Summary

This release includes improvements and bug fixes.

:::warning Backward-incompatible changes

- **MySQL Connector/J replaced with MariaDB Connector/J.** SSL is no longer enabled by default. If you connect to MySQL 8.0 or later with `caching_sha2_password` authentication, add `sslMode=REQUIRED` or `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true` to your JDBC URL. No action is required for `jdbc:mysql://` URLs because ScalarDB automatically appends `permitMysqlScheme` for compatibility.

:::

### Community edition

#### Improvements

- Replaced MySQL Connector/J with MariaDB Connector/J due to licensing concerns. ([#3428](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3428))
- Inserting or updating records with TIME (microsecond precision), TIMESTAMP (millisecond precision), and TIMESTAMPTZ (millisecond precision) column values will truncate out-of-range precision rather than throwing an exception. ([#3393](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3393))
- Shortened JDBC index names using a hash when they exceed the maximum identifier length supported by the underlying database. ([#3481](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3481))

#### Bug fixes

- Upgraded the Netty library to fix security issues: [CVE-2026-33870](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwqr-wmgm-9rr8 "CVE-2026-33870") and [CVE-2026-33871](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w9fj-cfpg-grvv "CVE-2026-33871") ([#3452](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/pull/3452))

### Enterprise edition

#### Improvements

##### ScalarDB SQL

- Updated the TIMESTAMPTZ literal to make optional the space character before the UTC timezone `Z` character. For example, `2021-03-04 12:30:45.123Z` is now accepted, in addition to the current format `2021-03-04 12:30:45.123 Z`. Also, when selecting a TIMESTAMPTZ column, the value is printed without a space before the `Z`.
- Fixed an issue where the shadow jar was unnecessarily published to GitHub Packages for the CLI module.
- Inserting or updating records with TIME (microsecond precision), TIMESTAMP (millisecond precision), and TIMESTAMPTZ (millisecond precision) column values will truncate out-of-range precision rather than throwing an exception.

#### Bug fixes

##### ScalarDB Cluster

- Upgraded `grpc_health_probe` to fix security issues: [CVE-2025-59250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m494-w24q-6f7w "CVE-2025-59250") and [CVE-2026-25679](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3gx-2473-5fp8 "CVE-2026-25679")
- Upgraded the Netty library to fix security issues: [CVE-2026-33870](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwqr-wmgm-9rr8 "CVE-2026-33870") and [CVE-2026-33871](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w9fj-cfpg-grvv "CVE-2026-33871")
- Upgraded `grpc_health_probe` to fix a security issue: [CVE-2026-34986](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78h2-9frx-2jm8 "CVE-2026-34986").

##### ScalarDB SQL

- Fixed a bug where duplicate column names were allowed in CREATE TABLE statements.
- Fixed missing strict date validation on time-related type formatters, which could allow invalid dates (e.g., February 30) to be silently accepted instead of rejected.

## v3.15.7
