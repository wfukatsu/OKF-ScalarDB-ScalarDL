# ScalarDB Roadmap

This roadmap provides a look into the proposed future of ScalarDB. The purpose of this roadmap is to provide visibility into what changes may be coming so that you can more closely follow progress, learn about key milestones, and give feedback during development. This roadmap will be updated as new versions of ScalarDB are released.

:::warning

During the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. **Do not schedule your release plans according to the contents of this roadmap.**

If you have a feature request or want to prioritize feature development, please create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/issues).

:::

### CY2026 Q2

#### New components

- **ScalarDB Saga**
- Users will be able to use ScalarDB Saga, a distributed transaction coordinator that implements the Saga pattern, to manage long-running transactions across multiple services and databases in a microservices architecture.
- **ScalarDB 2PC coordinator**
- Users will be able to use ScalarDB 2PC coordinator, a distributed transaction coordinator that implements the two-phase commit protocol, to manage distributed transactions across multiple services and databases in a microservices architecture.

#### New features

- **Authentication with OIDC**
- Users will be able to authenticate to ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics by using OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- **Universal authentication and authorization**
- Users will be able to be given access to ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics by using a unified authentication and authorization method.
- **Coordinator-based redo logging for pause-less backup**
- Users will be able to perform pause-less backup by using coordinator-based redo logging, which allows users to back up data without pausing the system.
- **Universal catalog**
- Users will be able to manage metadata, including schemas and semantic information, for operational and analytical databases across separate business domains in a unified manner.

#### Usability

- **Strongly consistent secondary index access**
- Users will be able to access secondary indexes with strong consistency so that they can get the most up-to-date data from secondary indexes.
- **Support more SQL syntax/features**
- Users will be able to use more SQL syntax/features in ScalarDB SQL so that they can express their intentions in a simpler way. For example, users will be able to use the IN operator in ScalarDB SQL.
- **Addition of DECIMAL data types**
- Users will be able to use DECIMAL data types so that users can handle decimal numbers with high precision.
- **Elimination of out-of-memory errors due to large scans**
- Users will be able to issue large scans without experiencing out-of-memory errors.

#### Performance

- **Reduction of storage space needed for managing ScalarDB metadata**
- Users will likely use less storage space to run ScalarDB. ScalarDB will remove the before image of committed transactions after they are committed. However, whether or not those committed transactions will impact actual storage space depends on the underlying databases.
- **Predicate pushdown**
- Users will be able to benefit from predicate pushdown in ScalarDB Analytics so that filtering operations are pushed down to the underlying databases to reduce data transfer and improve query performance.

#### Cloud support

- **Google Cloud Marketplace support for ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics by using the Google Cloud Marketplace offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.
- **Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog integration for ScalarDB Cluster**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster from Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog, which enables users to use ScalarDB Cluster as Red Hat-certified third-party products and services.

### CY2026 Q3

#### New features

- **Audit logging**
- Users will be able to view and manage the access logs of ScalarDB Cluster and Analytics, mainly for auditing purposes.
- **Native secondary index**
- Users will be able to define flexible secondary indexes. The existing secondary index is limited because it is implemented based on the common capabilities of the supported databases' secondary indexes. Therefore, for example, users cannot define a multi-column index. The new secondary index will be created at the ScalarDB layer so that users can create more flexible indexes, like a multi-column index.
- **Views**
- Users will be able to define views so that they can manage multiple different databases in an easier and simplified way.
- **Two-layered query engines**
- Users will be able to use two-layered query engines to better federate analytical queries across domains. The first-layer query engine is responsible for federating analytical queries across various domains, while the second-layer query engine federates analytical queries within a specific domain across its corresponding databases.
- **LangGraph4j integration**
- Users will be able to use LangGraph4j to build AI applications that can interact with ScalarDB.

#### Cloud support

- **Azure Marketplace support for ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics**
- Users will be able to deploy ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDB Analytics by using the Azure Marketplace offering, which enables users to use a pay-as-you-go subscription model.

#### Integration

- **Kong integration**
- Users will be able to integrate ScalarDB Cluster with Kong Ingress Controller so that they can manage and secure access to ScalarDB Cluster more easily.

### CY2026 Q4

#### New features

- **Stored procedures**
- Users will be able to define stored procedures so that they can execute a set of operations with a complex logic inside ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Triggers**
- Users will be able to define triggers so that they can automatically execute a set of operations when a specific event occurs in ScalarDB Cluster.
- **Queue interface**
- Users will be able to use ScalarDB as a message queue so that they can build event-driven architectures more easily.

#### Performance

- **Adaptive caching**
- Users will be able to benefit from adaptive caching in ScalarDB Analytics so that frequently accessed data is cached automatically to improve query performance.

### CY2027

#### New features

- **User-defined functions (UDFs)**
- Users will be able to define functions so that they can use functions in SQLs to express complex logic in a simpler way.
- **GraphDB support**
- Users will be able to use GraphDBs as underlying databases through ScalarDB Cluster.
