# Authenticate and Authorize Users

ScalarDB Cluster can authenticate and authorize users in a coarse-grained manner. You can create users and grant or revoke their privileges. Roles can also be created to group privileges and can be granted to users or other roles. This guide describes how to use authentication and authorization in ScalarDB SQL. For more details about the grammar, see [DCL](../scalardb-sql/grammar.md#dcl).

:::tip

You can also do authentication and authorization by using the primitive interface. For details, see [`ClusterClientTransactionAdmin`](https://javadoc.io/static/com.scalar-labs/scalardb-cluster-java-client-sdk/3.19.1/com/scalar/db/cluster/client/ClusterClientTransactionAdmin.html), which implements [`AuthAdmin`](https://javadoc.io/static/com.scalar-labs/scalardb/3.19.1/com/scalar/db/api/AuthAdmin.html).
:::

## Authentication methods

ScalarDB Cluster supports the following authentication methods:

- **Username and password (`USERPASS`):** Users authenticate with a username and password. This is the default method described in this guide.
- **OIDC (`OIDC`):** Client applications pass JWT access tokens from an OIDC provider (for example, Keycloak) instead of passwords. For details, see [Control User Access via OIDC-Based JWT Access Tokens](./control-access-via-oidc-based-jwt-tokens.md).

## Users

Users can log in to ScalarDB Cluster with a username and a password and execute SQL statements if they have the required privileges.

Authentication and authorization support two types of users:

- **Superusers:** This type of user has all privileges. Only superusers can create or drop other users and namespaces.
- **Normal users:** This type of user initially doesn't have any privileges, so they need to be granted privileges by a superuser or another user who has the `GRANT` privilege.

### Initial user

When you enable authentication and authorization, the initial user `admin` is created and the initial password of that user is `admin`. This user is a superuser and has all privileges. You can log in with this user and create other users if necessary.

:::warning

For security purposes, be sure to change the password of the initial user, especially before deploying to a production environment.

:::

## Roles

A role is a named collection of privileges that can be granted to users or other roles. Using roles provides a convenient way to manage privileges for multiple users, rather than granting individual privileges to each user.

Only superusers can create or drop roles. Users who have the `GRANT` privilege can grant their privileges to roles.

When a role is granted to a user, the user can use all privileges granted to that role. If the role has other roles granted to it (role hierarchy), the user can also use the privileges from those roles.

When granting a role, you can optionally specify `WITH ADMIN OPTION` to allow the grantee to grant the same role to others.

## Privileges

The following privileges are available when using authentication and authorization:

- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `CREATE`
- `DROP`
- `TRUNCATE`
- `ALTER`
- `GRANT`

### Which privileges are required for each type of operation

The following tables show which privileges are required for each type of operation:

#### DDL

| Command                       | Superuser required | Required privileges |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `CREATE NAMESPACE`            | `true`             |                     |
| `DROP NAMESPACE`              | `true`             |                     |
| `CREATE TABLE`                |                    | `CREATE`            |
| `DROP TABLE`                  |                    | `DROP`              |
| `CREATE INDEX`                |                    | `CREATE`            |
| `DROP INDEX`                  |                    | `DROP`              |
| `TRUNCATE TABLE`              |                    | `TRUNCATE`          |
| `ALTER TABLE`                 |                    | `ALTER`             |
| `CREATE COORDINATOR TABLES`   | `true`             |                     |
| `DROP COORDINATOR TABLES`     | `true`             |                     |
| `TRUNCATE COORDINATOR TABLES` | `true`             |                     |

#### DML

| Command  | Superuser required | Required privileges             |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SELECT` |                    | `SELECT`                        |
| `INSERT` |                    | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` |
| `UPSERT` |                    | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` |
| `UPDATE` |                    | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` |
| `DELETE` |                    | `SELECT` and `DELETE`            |

:::note

ScalarDB initially offered only the `Put` operation, which corresponds to `UPSERT`, for writing data. As a result, there is only one internal write permission. Consequently, the permissions needed for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `UPSERT` are the same; all of them require the `SELECT` privilege. In the future, ScalarDB plans to provide finer-grained write permissions.

## Configurations

This section describes the available configurations for authentication and authorization.

### ScalarDB Cluster node configurations

To enable authentication and authorization, you need to set `scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled` to `true`.

| Name                             | Description                        | Default |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled` | Whether authentication and authorization are enabled.  | `false` |

You can also set the following configurations:

| Name                                                           | Description                                                                                               | Default            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.cache_expiration_time_millis`          | Cache expiration time for authentication and authorization information in milliseconds.                                               | `60000` (1 minute) |
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.auth_token_expiration_time_minutes`    | Authentication and authorization token expiration time in minutes.                                                                    | `1440` (1 day)     |
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.auth_token_gc_thread_interval_minutes` | Authentication and authorization token garbage collection (GC) thread interval in minutes.                                            | `360` (6 hours)    |
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.pepper`                                | A secret value added to a password before hashing. If not specified, the password is hashed without pepper. |                    |

### ScalarDB Cluster Java client SDK configurations

To enable authentication and authorization on the client side, you need to set `scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled` to `true`.

| Name                             | Description                       | Default |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| `scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled` | Whether authentication and authorization are enabled. | `false` |

In addition to the configuration in the [ScalarDB Cluster SQL client configurations](./developer-guide-for-scalardb-cluster-with-java-api.md#scalardb-cluster-sql-client-configurations) section, you also need to set `scalar.db.sql.cluster_mode.username` and `scalar.db.sql.cluster_mode.password` to specify the username and password of the client.

| Name                                  | Description                 | Default |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| `scalar.db.sql.cluster_mode.username` | The username of the client. |         |
| `scalar.db.sql.cluster_mode.password` | The password of the client. |         |

## Passing credentials programmatically

The simplest way to provide credentials is to set them in the configuration properties: a username and password for the `userpass` authentication type, or a JWT access token for the `oidc_jwt` authentication type. However, this binds the client to a single ScalarDB user, and a token set in the properties cannot be refreshed when it expires. If your application needs to authenticate as different ScalarDB users at runtime (for example, when one application instance serves many end users), you can instead pass credentials programmatically on a per-thread, per-transaction, or per-operation basis, as described in the following sections. Each mechanism works with both authentication types.

### Passing credentials per thread

A credential holder sets credentials for the current thread for the duration of a block of code. All ScalarDB Cluster operations within the block are executed as the user identified by the held credentials.

Use `UserpassHolder` when the authentication type of the client is `userpass`, which is the default:

```java
import com.scalar.db.cluster.client.UserpassHolder;

UserpassHolder.executeWithUserpass(username, password, () -> {
    // All ScalarDB Cluster operations in this block are executed as the user who is authenticated with the specified username and password.
});
```

Use `OidcJwtAccessTokenHolder` when the authentication type of the client is `oidc_jwt`:

```java
import com.scalar.db.cluster.client.OidcJwtAccessTokenHolder;

OidcJwtAccessTokenHolder.executeWithToken(jwtAccessToken, () -> {
    // All ScalarDB Cluster operations in this block are executed as the user who is mapped from the specified token.
});
```

When using the holders, keep the following in mind:

- The credentials are set for the current thread only. Other threads are not affected, so you can safely use the holders concurrently from multiple threads.
- The credentials are resolved for each request. Therefore, when you begin a transaction within the block, also commit or roll it back within the block.
- The credentials are cleared automatically when the block completes, even if an exception is thrown.
- Nested calls of the same holder are not supported and throw an `IllegalStateException`.
- Credentials set in the holder for the other authentication type are ignored.
- The credentials set in a holder take precedence over the credentials set in the configuration properties.
- For `UserpassHolder`, the password will be `null` for users that don't have a password.

### Passing credentials as operation attributes

You can pass credentials for a specific transaction, operation, or SQL statement by using operation attributes. For details on operation attributes, see [Operation attributes](../api-guide.md#operation-attributes). The following attribute keys are reserved for authentication credentials:

| Key                          | Constant in `AuthOperationAttributes` | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `auth-type`                  | `TYPE`                                | The authentication method for the call. The value must be `userpass` or `oidc_jwt` (case-insensitive).  |
| `auth-userpass-username`     | `USERPASS_USERNAME`                   | The username when `auth-type` is `userpass`. Required.                                                  |
| `auth-userpass-password`     | `USERPASS_PASSWORD`                   | The password when `auth-type` is `userpass`. Optional for users who don't have a password.              |
| `auth-oidc-jwt-access-token` | `OIDC_JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN`               | The JWT access token when `auth-type` is `oidc_jwt`. Required.                                          |

The `com.scalar.db.cluster.client.AuthOperationAttributes` class provides these keys as constants, but you can also specify them as literal strings.

You can pass the auth attributes in the places described in the following sections. The examples use the `userpass` authentication type. For `oidc_jwt`, set `auth-type` to `oidc_jwt` and specify the JWT access token by using the `auth-oidc-jwt-access-token` key instead of the username and password keys.

#### For a transaction by using the primitive interface

Pass the attributes to the `begin()` or `beginReadOnly()` method on the transaction manager. All operations in the transaction authenticate as the specified user.

```java
import com.scalar.db.cluster.client.AuthOperationAttributes;

Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<>();
attributes.put(AuthOperationAttributes.TYPE, "userpass");
attributes.put(AuthOperationAttributes.USERPASS_USERNAME, "user1");
attributes.put(AuthOperationAttributes.USERPASS_PASSWORD, "password1");

DistributedTransaction transaction = manager.begin(attributes);
```

#### For a transaction by using the SQL interface

Pass the attributes to the `begin()` or `beginReadOnly()` method on `SqlSession`, or specify the keys in the `WITH` clause of the `BEGIN` or `START TRANSACTION` statement. All statements in the transaction authenticate as the specified user.

```sql
BEGIN WITH 'auth-type' = 'userpass'
  AND 'auth-userpass-username' = 'user1'
  AND 'auth-userpass-password' = 'password1';
```

#### For an operation executed directly on the transaction manager

For one-shot operations that you execute directly on the transaction manager without beginning a transaction, set the attributes on the operation itself by using the `attribute()` method in the operation builder. This works for any operation builder that supports the `attribute()` method, such as `Get`, `Scan`, `Insert`, `Upsert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.

```java
import com.scalar.db.cluster.client.AuthOperationAttributes;

Insert insert = Insert.newBuilder()
    .namespace("ns1")
    .table("tbl")
    .partitionKey(Key.ofInt("id", 1))
    .textValue("col1", "a")
    .attribute(AuthOperationAttributes.TYPE, "userpass")
    .attribute(AuthOperationAttributes.USERPASS_USERNAME, "user1")
    .attribute(AuthOperationAttributes.USERPASS_PASSWORD, "password1")
    .build();

manager.insert(insert);
```

#### For a SQL statement executed outside of a transaction

For SQL statements that you execute without beginning a transaction, specify the keys in the `WITH` clause of the statement. This works for any statement that supports the `WITH` clause, including prepared statements.

```sql
INSERT INTO ns1.tbl (id, col1) VALUES (1, 'a')
  WITH 'auth-type' = 'userpass'
  AND 'auth-userpass-username' = 'user1'
  AND 'auth-userpass-password' = 'password1';
```

#### How the auth attributes are handled

When passing credentials as operation attributes, keep the following in mind:

- If the `auth-type` attribute is present with a non-empty value, the specified credentials are used for that call, taking precedence over the credentials set for the current thread by a credential holder and the credentials set in the client configuration properties.
- When you pass the auth attributes in one of the places described above, the client removes them from the attributes before forwarding the request to the cluster, so the credentials don't appear in server-side logs or error messages. Other attributes in the same attribute map or `WITH` clause are preserved.
- The auth attributes are recognized only in the places described above. If you specify them anywhere else, such as on an operation or SQL statement that you execute within a transaction, they are not interpreted as credentials and are forwarded to the cluster as regular operation attributes.
- Invalid values, such as an unknown `auth-type` value or a missing required attribute, cause an `IllegalArgumentException` on the client side before any request is sent.
- When you execute a batch of SQL statements by using the `executeBatch()` method, only the auth attributes in the `WITH` clause of the first statement are used, and the selected credentials apply to the whole batch.
- Similarly, when you execute multiple operations in a single call on the transaction manager, for example, by using the `mutate()` method, only the auth attributes on the first operation are used, and the selected credentials apply to all operations in that call.
- If authentication and authorization are disabled (`scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled` is `false`), the auth attributes are ignored and the operation is executed without authentication. Therefore, you can keep the attributes in your application code even when deploying to an environment where authentication and authorization are disabled.

## Wire encryption

If you enable authentication and authorization, enabling wire encryption to protect the user credentials is strongly recommended, especially in production environments. For details about wire encryption, see [Encrypt Wire Communications](./encrypt-wire-communications.md).

```

It may take a few minutes for ScalarDB Cluster to fully start.

### 4. Connect to ScalarDB Cluster

To connect to ScalarDB Cluster, this tutorial uses the SQL CLI, a tool for connecting to ScalarDB Cluster and executing SQL queries. You can download the SQL CLI from the [ScalarDB releases page](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases).

Create a configuration file named `scalardb-cluster-sql-cli.properties`. This file will be used to connect to ScalarDB Cluster by using the SQL CLI.

```properties
scalar.db.sql.connection_mode=cluster
scalar.db.sql.cluster_mode.contact_points=indirect:localhost

# Enable authentication and authorization
scalar.db.cluster.auth.enabled=true
```

Then, start the SQL CLI by running the following command.

```console
java -jar scalardb-cluster-sql-cli-3.19.0-all.jar --config scalardb-cluster-sql-cli.properties
```

Enter the username and password as `admin` and `admin`, respectively.

Now you're ready to use the database with authentication and authorization enabled in ScalarDB Cluster.

### 5. Create namespaces and a table

Create namespaces.

```sql
CREATE NAMESPACE ns1;

CREATE NAMESPACE ns2;
```

Next, create a table in the `ns1` namespaces.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ns1.tbl (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  col1 TEXT,
  col2 INT);
```

### 6. Create a user

Create a user named `user1`.

```sql
CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'user1';
```

To check the user, run the following command.

```sql
SHOW USERS;
```

```console
+----------+-------------+-----------------------+
| username | isSuperuser | authenticationMethods |
+----------+-------------+-----------------------+
| user1    | false       | USERPASS              |
| admin    | true        | USERPASS              |
+----------+-------------+-----------------------+
```

You can see that the `user1` user has been created.

### 7. Grant privileges

Grant the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` privileges to `user1` on the `ns1.tbl` table.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ns1.tbl TO user1;
```

Then, grant the `SELECT` privilege to `user1` on the `ns2` namespace.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON NAMESPACE ns2 TO user1;
```

To check the privileges, run the following command.

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR user1;
```

```console
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
|  name   |   type    | privilege | grantedToUser | rolesProvidingPrivilege |
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
| ns2     | NAMESPACE | SELECT    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | SELECT    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | INSERT    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | UPDATE    | true          |                         |
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
```

You can see that `user1` has been granted the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` privileges on the `ns1.tbl` table, and the `SELECT` privilege on the `ns2` namespace.

### 8. Log in as `user1`

Log in as `user1` and execute SQL statements.

```console
java -jar scalardb-cluster-sql-cli-3.19.0-all.jar --config scalardb-cluster-sql-cli.properties
```

Enter the username and password as `user1` and `user1`, respectively.

Now you can execute SQL statements as `user1`.

### 9. Execute DML statements

Execute the following `INSERT` statement as `user1`.

```sql
INSERT INTO ns1.tbl VALUES (1, 'a', 1);
```

Then, execute the following `SELECT` statement as `user1`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ns1.tbl;
```

```console
+----+------+------+
| id | col1 | col2 |
+----+------+------+
| 1  | a    | 1    |
+----+------+------+
```

You can see that `user1` can execute `INSERT` and `SELECT` statements.

Next, try executing the following `DELETE` statement as `user1`.

```sql
DELETE FROM ns1.tbl WHERE id = 1;
```

```console
Error: Authorization error (PERMISSION_DENIED: SQL-10021: Access denied: You need the DELETE privilege on the table ns1.tbl to execute this operation) (state=SDB11,code=9911)
```

You will see the above error message because `user1` doesn't have the `DELETE` privilege on the `ns1.tbl` table.

### 10. Use roles to manage privileges

Log in as `admin` to create and manage roles.

```console
java -jar scalardb-cluster-sql-cli-3.19.0-all.jar --config scalardb-cluster-sql-cli.properties
```

Enter the username and password as `admin` and `admin`, respectively.

Create a role named `cleanup_role`.

```sql
CREATE ROLE cleanup_role;
```

To verify the role has been created, run the following command.

```sql
SHOW ROLES;
```

```console
+--------------+--------------+
|   roleName   | grantedRoles |
+--------------+--------------+
| cleanup_role |              |
+--------------+--------------+
```

Grant the `SELECT`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE` privileges on the `ns1.tbl` table to the role.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, DELETE, TRUNCATE ON ns1.tbl TO ROLE cleanup_role;
```

To verify the privileges granted to the role, run the following command.

```sql
SHOW ROLE GRANTS FOR cleanup_role;
```

```console
+---------+-------+-----------+
|  name   | type  | privilege |
+---------+-------+-----------+
| ns1.tbl | TABLE | SELECT    |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE | DELETE    |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE | TRUNCATE  |
+---------+-------+-----------+
```

Grant the role to `user1`.

```sql
GRANT ROLE cleanup_role TO user1;
```

To verify the privileges of `user1`, run the following command.

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR user1;
```

```console
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
|  name   |   type    | privilege | grantedToUser | rolesProvidingPrivilege |
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
| ns2     | NAMESPACE | SELECT    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | SELECT    | true          | cleanup_role            |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | INSERT    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | UPDATE    | true          |                         |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | DELETE    | false         | cleanup_role            |
| ns1.tbl | TABLE     | TRUNCATE  | false         | cleanup_role            |
+---------+-----------+-----------+---------------+-------------------------+
```

Now, log in as `user1` and try the `DELETE` statement again.

```console
java -jar scalardb-cluster-sql-cli-3.19.0-all.jar --config scalardb-cluster-sql-cli.properties
```

Enter the username and password as `user1` and `user1`, respectively.

```sql
DELETE FROM ns1.tbl WHERE id = 1;
```

This time, the statement succeeds because `user1` now has the `DELETE` privilege through the `cleanup_role` role.
