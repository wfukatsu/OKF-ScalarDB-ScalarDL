# Getting Started with ScalarDB Cluster GraphQL

This tutorial describes how to use ScalarDB Cluster GraphQL.

## Prerequisites

- One of the following Java Development Kits (JDKs):

- **[Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/):** 8, 11, 17, or 21 (LTS versions)
- **OpenJDK distribution ([Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/), [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/), or [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/)):** 8, 11, 17, or 21 (LTS versions)

- ScalarDB Cluster running on a Kubernetes cluster
  - We assume that you have a ScalarDB Cluster running on a Kubernetes cluster that you deployed by following the instructions in [Set Up ScalarDB Cluster on Kubernetes by Using a Helm Chart](./setup-scalardb-cluster-on-kubernetes-by-using-helm-chart.md).

## Sample application

This tutorial illustrates the process of creating an electronic money application, where money can be transferred between accounts.

The following diagram shows the system architecture of the sample application:

                              +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Step 1. Create `schema.json`

The following is a simple example schema.

Create `schema.json`, and add the following to the file:

```json
{
  "emoney.account": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [],
    "columns": {
      "id": "TEXT",
      "balance": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2. Create `database.properties`

You need to create `database.properties` for the Schema Loader for ScalarDB Cluster.
But first, you need to get the `EXTERNAL-IP` address of the service resource of Envoy (`scalardb-cluster-envoy`).

To see the `EXTERNAL-IP` address, run the following command:

```console
kubectl get svc scalardb-cluster-envoy
NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
scalardb-cluster-envoy   LoadBalancer   10.105.121.51   localhost     60053:30641/TCP   16h
```

In this case, the `EXTERNAL-IP` address is `localhost`.

Then, create `database.properties`, and add the following to the file:

```properties
scalar.db.transaction_manager=cluster
scalar.db.contact_points=indirect:localhost
```

To connect to ScalarDB Cluster, you need to specify `cluster` for the `scalar.db.transaction_manager` property.
In addition, you will use the `indirect` client mode and connect to the service resource of Envoy in this tutorial.
For details about the client modes, see [Developer Guide for ScalarDB Cluster with the Java API](./developer-guide-for-scalardb-cluster-with-java-api.md).

## Step 3. Load a schema

To load a schema via ScalarDB Cluster, you need to use the dedicated Schema Loader for ScalarDB Cluster (Schema Loader for Cluster).
Using the Schema Loader for Cluster is basically the same as using the [Schema Loader for ScalarDB](../schema-loader.md) except the name of the JAR file is different.
You can download the Schema Loader for Cluster from [ScalarDB Releases](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases/tag/v3.18.0).
After downloading the JAR file, you can run the Schema Loader for Cluster with the following command:

```console
java -jar scalardb-cluster-schema-loader-3.18.0-all.jar --config database.properties -f schema.json --coordinator
```

## Step 4. Run operations from GraphiQL

In ScalarDB Cluster, if the `scalar.db.graphql.graphiql` property is set to `true` (`true` is the default value), the GraphiQL IDE will be available.

To get the `EXTERNAL-IP` address of the service resource of ScalarDB Cluster GraphQL (`scalardb-cluster-graphql`), run the following command:

```console
kubectl get svc scalardb-cluster-graphql
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
scalardb-cluster-graphql   LoadBalancer   10.105.74.214   localhost     8080:30514/TCP   16h
```

In this case, the `EXTERNAL-IP` address is `localhost`, and the endpoint URL of GraphiQL IDE is `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.
Opening that URL with your web browser will take you to the GraphiQL screen.

Let's insert the first record.
In the left pane, paste the following mutation, then push the triangle-shaped `Execute Query` button at the top of the window.

```graphql
mutation PutUser1 {
  account_put(put: {key: {id: "user1"}, values: {balance: 1000}})
}
```

ScalarDB GraphQL always runs queries with transactions.
The above query starts a new transaction, executes a ScalarDB Put command, and commits the transaction at the end of the execution.

The following response from the GraphQL server will appear in the right pane:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "account_put": true
  }
}
```

The `"data"` field contains the result of the execution.
This response shows the `account_put` field of the mutation was successful.
The result type of mutations is `Boolean!`, which indicates whether the operation succeeded or not.

Next, let's get the record you just inserted.
Paste the following query next to the previous mutation in the left pane, and click the `Execute Query` button.
Since you don't delete the `mutation PutUser1` above, a pull-down menu will appear below the button, and you can choose which operation should be executed. Choose `GetUser1`, as shown below:

```graphql
query GetUser1 {
  account_get(get: {key: {id: "user1"}}) {
    account {
      id
      balance
    }
  }
}
```

You should get the following result in the right pane:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "account_get": {
      "account": {
        "id": "user1",
        "balance": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mappings between GraphQL API and ScalarDB Java API

The automatically generated GraphQL schema defines queries, mutations, and object types for input/output to allow you to run CRUD operations for all the tables in the target namespaces. These operations are designed to match the ScalarDB APIs defined in the [`DistributedTransaction`](https://javadoc.io/static/com.scalar-labs/scalardb/3.18.0/com/scalar/db/api/DistributedTransaction.html) interface.

Assuming you have an `account` table in a namespace, the following queries and mutations will be generated:

| ScalarDB API                                           | GraphQL root type | GraphQL field                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `get(Get get)`                                         | `Query`           | `account_get(get: account_GetInput!): account_GetPayload`                          |
| `scan(Scan scan)`                                      | `Query`           | `account_scan(scan: account_ScanInput!): account_ScanPayload`                      |
| `put(Put put)`                                         | `Mutation`        | `account_put(put: account_PutInput!): Boolean!`                                    |
| `put(java.util.List<Put> puts)`                        | `Mutation`        | `account_bulkPut(put: [account_PutInput!]!): Boolean!`                             |
| `delete(Delete delete)`                                | `Mutation`        | `account_delete(delete: account_DeleteInput!): Boolean!`                           |
| `delete(java.util.List<Delete> deletes)`               | `Mutation`        | `account_bulkDelete(delete: [account_DeleteInput!]!): Boolean!`                    |
| `mutate(java.util.List<? extends Mutation> mutations)` | `Mutation`        | `account_mutate(put: [account_PutInput!]delete: [account_DeleteInput!]): Boolean!` |

Note that the `scan` field is not generated for a table with no clustering key.
This is the reason why the `account_scan` field is not available in this electronic money sample application.

You can see all generated GraphQL types in GraphiQL's Documentation Explorer (the `< Docs` link at the top-left corner).

## Step 5. Run a transaction across multiple requests from GraphiQL

Let's run a transaction that spans multiple GraphQL requests.

The generated schema provides the `@transaction` directive that allows you to identify transactions.
You can use this directive with both queries and mutations.

Before starting a transaction, you need to insert the necessary record with the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation PutUser2 {
  account_put(put: {key: {id: "user2"}, values: {balance: 1000}})
}
```

### Start a transaction before running an operation

Running the following to add a `@transaction` directive with no arguments to a query or mutation directs the execution to start a new transaction:

```graphql
query GetAccounts @transaction {
  user1: account_get(get: {key: {id: "user1"}}) {
    account { balance }
  }
  user2: account_get(get: {key: {id: "user2"}}) {
    account { balance }
  }
}
```

After running the above command, you will get a result with a transaction ID in the `extensions` field.
The `id` value in the extensions is the transaction ID in which the operation in the request was run.
In this case, the following is the new ID of the transaction just started by the request:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user1": {
      "account": {
        "balance": 1000
      }
    },
    "user2": {
      "account": {
        "balance": 1000
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "transaction": {
      "id": "c88da8a6-a13f-4857-82fe-45f1ab4150f9"
    }
  }
}
```

### Run an operation in a continued transaction

To run the next queries or mutations in the transaction you started, specify the transaction ID as the `id` argument of the `@transaction`.
The following example updates two accounts you retrieved in the previous example by transferring a balance from user1's account to user2's account in the same transaction:

```graphql
mutation Transfer @transaction(id: "c88da8a6-a13f-4857-82fe-45f1ab4150f9") {
  user1: account_put(put: {key: {id: "user1"}, values: {balance: 750}})
  user2: account_put(put: {key: {id: "user2"}, values: {balance: 1250}})
}
```

Note that a transaction started with GraphQL has a timeout of 1 minute (by default) and will be aborted automatically if it exceeds the timeout.

### Commit a transaction

To commit the continued transaction, specify both the `id` and the `commit: true` flag as arguments of the `@transaction` directive:

```graphql
query GetAndCommit @transaction(id: "c88da8a6-a13f-4857-82fe-45f1ab4150f9", commit: true) {
  user1: account_get(get: {key: {id: "user1"}}) {
    account { balance }
  }
  user2: account_get(get: {key: {id: "user2"}}) {
    account { balance }
  }
}
```

**Note:** If you specify a `commit: true` flag without an `id` argument like `@transaction(commit: true)`, a new transaction will start and be committed just for one operation.
This behavior is exactly the same as not specifying the `@transaction` directive, as seen in the above examples using GraphiQL.
In other words, you can omit the directive itself when `@transaction(commit: true)` is specified.

### Abort or roll back a transaction

If you need to abort or roll back a transaction explicitly, you can use the `abort` or `rollback` mutation fields interchangeably (both have the same effect and usage).
Note that you cannot mix these fields with any other operations, so you must specify only the `abort` or `rollback` mutation field as follows:
